1. The context mentions "extremely limited exceptions" which contradicts the statement's claim of eliminating all exceptions.
2. The existence of a statute (31 U.S.C.) regulating exceptions suggests that some exceptions are acknowledged and thus not eliminated.
3. The phrase "extremely limited" implies a small number of exceptions, which is incompatible with the statement's assertion of their complete elimination.
