1. The context and statement refer to different seasons, making it impossible to determine if they are related.
2. The numbers of items being correlated differ (5 vs. 6), which could mean they are discussing separate phenomena.
3. The areas mentioned in each statement might be different, leading to undetermined correlation between them.
4. Correlation patterns can vary significantly by region, so what is true for summer may not be true for winter in the same areas.
