1. The statement conflates the government's promise with its overall flaw, which may not necessarily be true if the government has fulfilled other promises but still lacks in this particular area.
2. The context implies ongoing work rather than a complete failure, suggesting some aspects of the government function adequately.
3. The phrase "unfulfilled" in the context refers to a specific promise, not the entire government.
4. The statement generalizes the government's nature based on one incomplete aspect, which oversimplifies the complexity of governmental operations and responsibilities.
