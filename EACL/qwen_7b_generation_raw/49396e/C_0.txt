1. The statement implies the road is entirely free of tourists, which contradicts the context mentioning "untouched by tourism" only in relation to being affected by tourism, not that there are absolutely no tourists present.
2. The context describes the road as traveling through "fishing villages," suggesting potential local visitors or tourists interested in these villages.
3. Agricultural towns often attract tourists interested in rural experiences, farm tours, or local produce, contradicting the claim of no tourists.
4. Fishing villages typically draw anglers and nature enthusiasts, who could be considered tourists, thus refuting the statement.
