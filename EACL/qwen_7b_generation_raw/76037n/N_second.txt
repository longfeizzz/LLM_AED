1. The speaker's tone and context of "You did, didn't you?" suggests the action has already occurred, while the statement queries unintentionality, creating a contradiction in timing.
2. The two questions address different aspects of the action: one about its occurrence and the other about intent, making it unclear if they refer to the same event.
3. There is no information provided to confirm or deny whether the action was intentional or not, leaving the statement undetermined.
