1. FGD and SCR technologies serve different purposes and have distinct designs, making replication impractical.
2. The construction proximity to the ground does not imply functional similarity or replication potential between FGD and SCR systems.
3. Replication would require identical design and function, which contradicts their differing roles in pollution control processes.
