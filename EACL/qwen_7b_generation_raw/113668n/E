3. By imposing restrictions and allowing for proportional reductions, Section 414 directly contributes to achieving balanced allowance allocations among units.
4. The requirement for pro rata reductions in Section 414 prevents any unit from disproportionately benefiting or suffering, thus maintaining balance.
5. Section 414 provides a regulatory framework that necessitates adjustments to reflect compliance with broader environmental goals, thereby promoting overall balance.
