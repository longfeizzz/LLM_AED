1. The statement misinterprets the cost implications; if Gross can siphon off $400 per person from $1,000 total ad spending, it implies he is taking money away from other advertisers, not saving them money.
2. The question suggests Gross may be persuading advertisers to spend more, which contradicts the notion that the internet saves him money.
3. The context implies potential conflicts of interest between Gross and advertisers, making it unlikely the internet saves him money.
