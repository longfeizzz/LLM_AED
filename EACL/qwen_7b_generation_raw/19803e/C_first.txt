1. The statement "Surely there's something" aligns with the context "But there's SOMETHING," making it redundant and potentially contradictory if interpreted as a separate assertion.
2. The use of "Surely" implies certainty, which may conflict with the implication of uncertainty or need for confirmation suggested by "But there's SOMETHING."
3. The capitalization of "SOMETHING" suggests emphasis or a specific point being made, whereas "something" in the statement appears more general, possibly diluting the intended impact.
