1. Starting plants in spring allows them to acclimate gradually to warmer temperatures, avoiding extreme heat stress in summer.
2. Spring soil temperatures are more favorable for seed germination and root development compared to hotter summer conditions.
3. Plants started in spring have more time to grow before summer, reducing exposure to high temperatures.
4. Spring planting enables better establishment of roots, supporting the plant through the subsequent hot summer months.
