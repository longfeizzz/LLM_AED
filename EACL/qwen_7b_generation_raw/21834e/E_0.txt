1. The world's operations prioritize local needs and policies over catering to foreign tourists' moral expectations.
2. Governments and organizations focus on domestic issues rather than creating environments that reflect specific tourist morals.
3. Tourists represent a small fraction of the global population, thus their moral standards do not influence world governance.
4. Decision-making processes are driven by economic, political, and social factors that transcend individual tourist morals.
