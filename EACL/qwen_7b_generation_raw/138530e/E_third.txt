1. The vibration translated into a quiet hum due to the frequency and amplitude of the vibrations being within the range of human auditory perception.
2. The object was designed to produce both tactile and auditory feedback simultaneously, resulting in a quiet hum when touched.
3. The surface of the object had small, rapid movements that created a vibration, which, at a certain intensity, produced a faint humming sound.
4. The material of the object resonated when vibrated, amplifying the sound to a quiet hum detectable by the user's hand.
5. The movement inside the object caused air displacement, creating a subtle humming noise as it interacted with the surrounding environment.
