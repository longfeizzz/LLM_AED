1. The statement contradicts the context which describes the Leal Senado as "impressive" and a "fine example of colonial architecture," suggesting it is well-preserved.
2. The context mentions entering an "entrance hall," implying the building has intact interior spaces, which would not be present in ruins.
3. The use of "all that remains" in the statement is inconsistent with the description of the Leal Senado as a building with architectural merit.
