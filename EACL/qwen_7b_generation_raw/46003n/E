1. High temperatures increase water evaporation, requiring more frequent and substantial watering to maintain grass hydration.
2. Summer heat often leads to increased nutrient depletion in soil, necessitating more fertilizer applications to support grass health.
3. Larger areas require more resources for both watering and fertilizing, amplifying costs.
4. Summer pests and diseases are more prevalent, potentially increasing the need for additional treatments that come with costs.
