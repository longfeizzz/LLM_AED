1. The claim that David Cope created a 42nd Mozart symphony contradicts historical facts; Mozart composed and published only 41 symphonies.
2. David Cope specializes in composition and artificial intelligence, not specifically in Mozart's music, making his claim less credible in the context provided.
3. Mozart's 42nd symphony would imply a new work that was neither composed nor attributed to Mozart historically, which is false.
