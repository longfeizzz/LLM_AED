1. The statement is vague and lacks specific criteria for "that" which makes it impossible to evaluate its truthfulness across states.
2. Without a clear definition of "that," it's impossible to determine if most states possess it.
3. The term "most" is subjective and requires a defined threshold for accuracy, which is missing here.
4. States differ widely in many aspects; "that" could refer to various attributes, making a blanket statement about most states inaccurate without context.
