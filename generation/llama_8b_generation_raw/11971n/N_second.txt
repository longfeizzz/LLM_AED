1. The study was six years long, which may not be long enough to detect potential long-term effects of irradiated chicken consumption.
2. The study only observed dogs and other animals, so it may not be generalizable to other species or to humans.
3. The study only looked for increased cancer or toxic effects, so it may not have detected other potential effects of irradiated chicken consumption.
4. The study may not have had sufficient statistical power to detect small effects.
5. The study may have had methodological limitations that prevented it from accurately detecting potential effects of irradiated chicken consumption.
6. The study only observed the animals' lifespan, which may not be a sensitive enough outcome measure to detect potential effects of irradiated chicken consumption.
7. The study may not have controlled for other potential confounding variables that could have influenced the results.
8. The study may have had a small sample size, which could have limited its ability to detect potential effects of irradiated chicken consumption.
9. The study's results may not be generalizable to different types of irradiation or different levels of irradiation.
10. The study may not have looked at the irradiated chicken's nutritional content or other factors that could have influenced the results.
