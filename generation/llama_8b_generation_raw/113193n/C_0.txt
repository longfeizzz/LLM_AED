1. The statement is too absolute, as it implies all Cubans would react in the same way, but the original statement suggests they "wouldn't like that a bit", which is a more nuanced expression.
2. The statement implies a violent reaction, but the original statement uses "go up in arms" metaphorically, suggesting a strong opposition, not necessarily a violent one.
3. The statement assumes a direct annexation attempt, but the original statement mentions annexing Cuba, which could be a more diplomatic or economic process.
4. The statement implies a high level of resistance, but the original statement suggests a more general disapproval ("wouldn't like that a bit") rather than a full-scale rebellion.
