1. The statement is false because the context does not specify which architect is being referred to, so it's possible that the architect was the same but the context is incomplete.
2. The statement is false because the context implies a comparison but does not specify what the comparison is, making it unclear what "the same architect" refers to.
3. The statement is false because there is no information in the context to support the claim that the architect was not used.
4. The statement is false because it's possible that the architect was involved in the project but not in the capacity of designing the Taj Mahal.
5. The statement is false because the context is ambiguous and could be interpreted in multiple ways, making the claim false due to lack of clarity.
