1. The statement and the context provide different values for the increase, making the relationship between the statement and the context indeterminate.
2. The context does not provide information about whether the actual increase matches the expected increase.
3. The statement does not specify the time frame or period over which the increase was expected, making it difficult to compare with the context.
4. The context only mentions the actual increase, not the expected increase, making it unclear if the statement is true or false.
5. The statement and the context are about different aspects of the volume (expected vs actual), making it unclear how to evaluate the relationship.
