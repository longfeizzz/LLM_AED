1. The statement implies a complete elimination of coupons, which contradicts the fact that coupon collecting is still allowed in some US stores.
2. The statement suggests a universal change in store policies, but it is not specified which stores are affected.
3. The statement implies that coupon collecting is no longer allowed in any US store, which is not supported by the context that only the typical member of the co-op has become less willing to go out.
4. The statement implies a direct correlation between consumer confidence and coupon collecting, but the context only suggests an indirect relationship where the co-op member becomes less willing to go out and accumulate coupons.
5. The statement implies that the decline in consumer confidence has led to a complete elimination of coupons, which is not a logical consequence of the described behavior change.
