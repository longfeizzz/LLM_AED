1. The statement assumes a uniformity that may not be achievable in practice due to differences in individual perceptions and experiences.
2. Hypothetical market situations can vary across respondents due to differences in their backgrounds, knowledge, and expectations.
3. The contingent valuation approach often relies on respondents' subjective judgments, which can lead to inconsistent answers across different hypothetical scenarios.
4. The uniformity assumption may not account for the potential biases and variability in respondents' answers due to factors like social desirability or anchoring effects.
5. Hypothetical market situations can be complex and context-dependent, making it challenging to ensure uniformity across all respondents.
6. The statement ignores the potential for respondents to interpret hypothetical market situations differently, leading to varying levels of uniformity.
7. The contingent valuation approach may not provide sufficient context or clarity for respondents to understand the hypothetical market situations uniformly.
8. Respondents' answers can be influenced by their personal values, attitudes, and experiences, which can lead to non-uniform responses across different hypothetical scenarios.
9. The uniformity assumption may not be supported by the data, as respondents' answers can be highly variable and context-dependent.
10. The statement oversimplifies the complexities of human decision-making, which can lead to non-uniform responses
