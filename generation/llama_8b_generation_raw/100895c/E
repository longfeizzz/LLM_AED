1. The statement implies that resources are inherent to every output, which is a fundamental assumption in the context of evaluating generalizability.
2. The presence of resources in every output suggests that generalizability can be evaluated by examining the resources associated with each output.
3. The statement implies that resources are a necessary component of every output, which could be a basis for generalizing across different outputs.
4. Every output having resources implies that the absence of resources is not a possibility, which could inform generalizability judgments.
