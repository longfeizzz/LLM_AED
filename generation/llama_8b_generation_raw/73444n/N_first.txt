1. The statement assumes a binary outcome (win or lose) but the context implies that the motivation comes from being close to a historic achievement.
2. The context suggests motivation is already present due to their proximity to the historic achievement, making the statement redundant.
3. The statement implies that motivation is solely dependent on not suffering losses, which is not necessarily true given the context.
4. The context implies that motivation is not solely dependent on the outcome, but also on the desire to make history, which is not addressed in the statement.
5. The statement is too simplistic, as motivation can be influenced by various factors beyond just the outcome of the game.
