1. The statement is a generalization, while the context provides an exception.
2. The context states that auditors may still serve as a useful source of guidance even if they don't follow certain standards, implying flexibility rather than strict compliance.
3. The context does not mention GAGAS requiring strict compliance, but rather mentions auditors following other standards and methodologies.
4. The context implies that auditors have flexibility in planning their work under GAGAS, which contradicts the idea of strict compliance.
5. The context does not provide information about GAGAS requirements, so it cannot be determined if GAGAS requires strict compliance.
