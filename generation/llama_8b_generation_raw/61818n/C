1. DSM-III-R is a revised edition, not a book of personality disorders.
2. The DSM-III-R contains a revised criteria-set, but the original statement implies it's a book of personality disorders, which is not entirely accurate.
3. The statement is false because it's too narrow, as DSM-III-R includes criteria for various disorders, not just personality disorders.
4. The statement is false because the example given is about a personality disorder that was suggested but not included in the DSM-III-R, implying that not all personality disorders are included in the book.
5. The statement is false because the example given is about a committee composing criteria for a personality disorder, not about the book itself being a book of personality disorders.
