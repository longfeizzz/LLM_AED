1. The statement implies a separate tax on the menu, which contradicts the context that most menu prices include taxes.
2. The statement is unclear about what "the tax on the menus" refers to, as the context indicates that taxes are already included in menu prices.
3. The statement uses the phrase "in addition to," which suggests that the tax and tip are separate entities, but the context implies that the tip is in addition to the service charge, not a separate tax.
4. The statement is ambiguous about whether it's referring to a service charge or a tax, leading to uncertainty about the intended meaning.
