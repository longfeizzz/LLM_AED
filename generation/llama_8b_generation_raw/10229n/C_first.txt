1. The statement is about the length of the process and its future reform, which is not directly related to the governing statute's description of the committee composition.
2. The governing statute does not mention anything about the length of the process or its potential reform, so the statement is making an assumption not supported by the given context.
3. The statement implies that the process has issues that need to be addressed, but the governing statute does not provide any information about the process's effectiveness or problems.
4. The statement is about future reform, but the governing statute only describes the current composition of the committee, not any potential changes or reforms.
5. The governing statute does not provide any information about the timeline of the process, so the statement's claim about the length of the process is unsubstantiated.
