1. The statement is too vague, as it doesn't specify which judicial decisions it is referring to.
2. The statement implies that race is not always a decisive factor, which contradicts the idea that tolerating it at all means tolerating it as potentially the decisive factor.
3. The statement may be true in some cases but does not address the broader implications of tolerating race as a factor in decision-making.
4. The statement does not consider the potential for cumulative bias, where multiple factors (including race) combine to influence the decision.
5. The statement does not account for the possibility of implicit bias, where judges may unconsciously use race as a factor in their decision-making.
6. The statement implies that the presence of other factors mitigates the impact of race, which is not necessarily the case.
7. The statement does not address the issue of whether the presence of multiple factors justifies the use of race as a factor in decision-making.
8. The statement may be true in some cases but does not capture the full complexity of the issue.
