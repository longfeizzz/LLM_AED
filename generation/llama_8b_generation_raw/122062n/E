1. The statement implies that founding an order is a common activity among kings, which is supported by the context.
2. The order's ability to continue today suggests that it has been maintained over time, which is consistent with the statement's implication.

4. The statement's truth is not dependent on the specific king who founded the order, but rather the fact that a king was involved, which is the case here.
5. The fact that the order continues today implies that it has been able to maintain itself over time, which is consistent with the idea that kings frequently founded orders that can still be found today.
