1. The statement is false given the context, as the context assumes a roughly proportional relationship.
2. The statement contradicts the underlying assumption in the context that the relationship is roughly proportional.
3. The context implies that the AC usage is directly related to the MWe of coal-fired facilities equipped with the technology, making the statement incorrect.
4. The statement is inconsistent with the context's assumption of an average capacity factor of 85 percent.
5. The context implies that the AC usage should be lower than the MWe of coal facilities, not higher.
