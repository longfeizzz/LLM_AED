1. The statement contradicts the assumption of rough proportionality between AC usage and total MWe of coal-fired facilities.
2. The assumption of an average capacity factor of 85 percent implies that AC usage should be lower than total MWe due to reduced energy production.
3. The statement suggests an inverse relationship between AC usage and total MWe, which is opposite to the assumed proportionality.
4. The statement cannot be true given the context that assumes a direct relationship between AC usage and total MWe.
5. The statement implies that AC usage exceeds total MWe, which contradicts the given context's assumption of proportionality.
