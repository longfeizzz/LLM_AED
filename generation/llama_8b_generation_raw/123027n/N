1. The statement is too specific about the cause of the temperature (sweat) while the context only mentions a condition (high humidity).
2. The statement implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship between sweat and temperature, which is not explicitly supported by the context.
3. The statement focuses on a symptom (sweat) rather than the underlying condition (high humidity) described in the context.
4. The statement assumes a specific temperature range that may not be universally applicable to all situations with high humidity.
5. The context does not provide enough information to determine if the statement is true or false, making it undetermined.
