1. The Chinese calendar is known for its accuracy and precision in tracking time cycles.
2. The use of a well-established cosmological cycle, such as the Chinese calendar's 1,260-year cycle, implies a high degree of reliability.
3. Calculating the year of foundation by counting back a specific number of years in a known cycle suggests a straightforward and precise method.
4. The fact that a specific number of years was used (1,260) indicates a deliberate and careful calculation.
5. The Chinese calendar's system of tracking time cycles is based on astronomical observations, which are generally reliable.
6. The use of a long cycle (1,260 years) reduces the margin of error when counting back to find the year of foundation.
7. The calculation is based on a well-documented and widely accepted system, which suggests a high degree of accuracy.
