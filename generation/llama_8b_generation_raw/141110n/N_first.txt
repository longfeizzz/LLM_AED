1. The statement is contradicted by the speaker's previous statement that "it's pretty much funded".
2. The speaker's statement that "there are small colleges that I'm sure are struggling" implies that not all small colleges are struggling, which undermines the general statement about small colleges.
3. The speaker's mention of "higher level education" suggests that the issue of funding and resources might be more prevalent in lower-level education, which could be a context-dependent exception to the general statement.
4. The speaker's tone and language ("yeah", "um", "actually actually") suggest a lack of confidence or certainty in their statement, which could imply that the relationship is undetermined.
