1. The statement implies a direct color correlation, but the protuberances are the ones with the red color, not their bodies.

3. The statement implies a direct association between the red color of the redcoats and the red color on their bodies, but the context suggests the association is with the red protuberances.
4. The statement is based on an assumption that the redcoats were known for their bright red color, but the statement does not provide evidence for this.
5. The statement is based on an assumption that the name was given due to a superficial characteristic (color), but the context suggests the name may be due to a more specific feature (the protuberances).
6. The statement does not account for the possibility that the name is due to other factors besides the color similarity.
