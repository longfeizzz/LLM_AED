1. The statement's truth value depends on the specific context of "all exceptions," which is not explicitly defined in the given statement or context.
2. The statement implies a complete elimination of exceptions, but the context only mentions "extremely limited exceptions," which may not be the same as "all exceptions."
3. The statement's meaning is ambiguous due to the absence of a clear scope for "all exceptions," making it difficult to determine its relationship to the context.
4. The statement may be referring to a different set of exceptions not mentioned in the context, which would make it undetermined based on the given information.
5. The statement's relationship to the context is undetermined because it does not specify whether the exceptions mentioned in the context are included in the "all exceptions" being referred to.
