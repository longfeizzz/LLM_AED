1. The statement only compares height, but the text implies Ca'daan's comparison was of overall size or stature, which could include other factors like muscle mass or build.
2. The statement is based on a comparison to "the rest," but the text specifies "the rest" as referring to the other people on horseback, while the statement does not specify who the comparison is being made to.
3. The text does not explicitly state that he was shorter, only that Ca'daan thought he was smaller than the others.
4. The comparison is subjective and based on Ca'daan's perception, but the statement presents it as an objective fact.
5. The statement assumes a direct correlation between being smaller and being shorter, which may not be the case.
6. The statement does not account for the possibility that the others were sitting on horseback, which could affect the apparent size comparison.
