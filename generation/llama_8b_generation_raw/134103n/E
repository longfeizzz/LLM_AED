1. He walked out into the street, which implies movement, and I followed him, indicating that I moved in the same direction.
2. The context establishes a causal relationship between his action and my action, where his walking out into the street led to my following him.
3. The word "followed" implies a direction of movement, and since he walked out into the street, it is reasonable to infer that I followed him in the same direction.
4. Given that he walked out into the street, it is likely that he moved down the street, and since I followed him, it is also likely that I moved down the street.
5. The context suggests a spatial relationship between the two actions, where one action (him walking out into the street) leads to the other action (me following him) in a specific location (the street).
