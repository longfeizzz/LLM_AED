1. The Access to Justice supplement is added to court filing fees, so increasing it would result in higher fees, not lower.
2. The legislation introduced by Charles Geveden increases the Access to Justice supplement, implying that the overall court filing fees would increase, not decrease.
3. The phrase "essentially lower" is misleading as increasing the Access to Justice supplement would increase the overall cost, not lower it.
