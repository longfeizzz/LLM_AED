2. The reason for diving bans in other places is not necessarily the protection of ancient sites.
3. The statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the protection of ancient sites and diving bans, which may not be universally applicable.
4. The statement assumes that the primary reason for diving bans is the protection of ancient sites, which may not be the case.
5. The statement is too narrow in its explanation, as there may be other reasons for diving bans in other places.
6. The statement's implication that the absence of ancient sites in Mykonos is the reason for the lack of diving bans is an oversimplification.
