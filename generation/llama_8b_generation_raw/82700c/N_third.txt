1. The statement is about the frequency of invasions in Russia, but the context is about a historical figure's campaign in Russia, which is unrelated to the topic of invasion frequency.
2. The context does not provide any information about the outcome or success of invasions in Russia, making it impossible to determine if Russia has been successfully invaded hundreds of times.
3. The term "successfully invaded" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways, making it difficult to determine the intended meaning.
4. The statement is a general claim that cannot be verified or falsified based on the provided context, which only discusses a historical figure's campaign in Russia.
