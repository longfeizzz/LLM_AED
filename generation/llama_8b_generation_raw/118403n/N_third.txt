1. The statement is contradicted by the context, which implies that the temperature is already starting to get warmer, making it unclear what "colder" refers to.
2. The context does not provide enough information to determine if planting during a warmer period is better or worse than planting during a colder period.
3. The statement is undetermined because it lacks context about the specific type of plant, the region's climate, or the optimal temperature range for planting.
4. The statement is undetermined because it is unclear what "better" means in this context, whether it refers to growth rate, yield, or another factor.
5. The statement is undetermined because the context suggests that the speaker does not think the timing of planting has a significant impact, making the statement about planting in colder conditions irrelevant.
