1. The maharaja's initial action of forbidding the British from buying land was a precursor to allowing them to build houseboats, which served the same purpose.
2. The maharaja's decision to allow houseboats was a compromise to accommodate the British, who wanted to reside in the area.
3. The maharaja implicitly allowed the British to build houseboats by not prohibiting it, given the context that they were looking for an alternative to buying land.
4. The statement might be an inference that the maharaja's initial action was not entirely successful in preventing British presence in the area, as houseboats were built anyway.
