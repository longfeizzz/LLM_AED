1. The term "sets" implies a collection of items, but it doesn't necessarily mean they need to be filled or completed.
2. The context uses "critical success factors," which suggests that each set is a factor contributing to success, not that they need to be filled.
3. The word "sets" can refer to groups or categories, not necessarily tasks or activities that need to be completed.
4. The statement assumes that success is binary, but it's possible that success can be achieved with fewer than three sets.
5. The context implies that the three sets are distinct categories, not sequential steps that need to be completed.
6. The term "critical success factors" doesn't necessarily imply that all factors need to be fulfilled simultaneously.
