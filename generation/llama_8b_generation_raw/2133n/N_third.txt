2. The context suggests the catacombs are hardly worth exploring, which contradicts the idea of a thorough tour being provided.
3. The context implies the catacombs are small and circular, which may not be suitable for a thorough tour.
4. The statement is too absolute, implying a complete and comprehensive tour, whereas the context suggests the exploration is limited and hardly worth the effort.
