1. The statement implies a geographical separation between the alpine frontier and Italy, which is true as glaciers are present in the alpine region and can act as a physical barrier.

3. Glaciers are found in mountainous regions, and the alpine frontier is described as being on the northwestern Alpine frontier, making the presence of glaciers a logical consequence.
