1. The speaker found the item on clearance, which indicates it was a sale item, not a non-sale item.
2. The statement "we found it with a clearance" directly contradicts the idea of buying non-sale items.
3. The context implies that the item was found in a clearance section, which typically contains sale items, not non-sale items.
4. The location "down in Memphis" does not provide enough information to determine the nature of the items or the purchase method.
5. The use of the word "guess" indicates uncertainty about the location, which may also imply uncertainty about other details of the purchase.
6. The speaker does not explicitly state that the items were non-sale items; the statement is an inference that may not be supported by the context.
