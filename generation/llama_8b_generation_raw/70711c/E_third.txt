1. If started during spring, the temperature will be cooler for a longer period, reducing stress.
2. Starting in spring allows the plants to grow at a slower rate, making them more resilient to heat.
3. Cooler spring temperatures prevent damage from extreme heat during the initial growth stage.
4. Starting in spring gives the plants a head start before the hot summer months.
5. Plants started in spring have more time to develop a strong root system before the heat sets in.
6. The cooler temperatures in spring allow for more efficient water absorption and nutrient uptake.
7. Spring planting reduces the risk of heat stress and related issues like leaf scorch.
8. Plants grown in cooler temperatures have a more even growth pattern, which can help them tolerate heat better.
