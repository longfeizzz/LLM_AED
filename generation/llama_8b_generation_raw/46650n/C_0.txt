1. The bait refers to the draft treaty itself, which is being used to lure someone, so the statement implies that the bait is something separate from the treaty.
2. The statement implies that Tommy is the one being lured, but in the context, the draft treaty is Tommy's bait, suggesting that Tommy is the one using the bait to lure someone else.
3. The phrase "took the bait" typically implies that someone fell for the bait, but in this context, the draft treaty is being used as bait, so the statement doesn't fit the usual meaning of the phrase.
4. The statement implies a direct object (the bait) being taken by Tommy, but in the context, the draft treaty is the bait itself, not something being taken.
