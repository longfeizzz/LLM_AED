1. The statement is about replication, which does not necessarily imply a physical similarity in construction height.
2. The context only discusses construction height, which is not relevant to the concept of replication.
3. Replication in a technical sense may refer to the functionality or efficiency of FGD systems in relation to SCR systems, not their physical construction.
4. The statement may be referring to the design or operational goals of FGD systems, rather than their physical construction.
5. The comparison is not about the physical construction height but rather the design or functionality goals of the two systems.
