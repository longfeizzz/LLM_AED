1. FGD systems are constructed at different heights compared to SCR systems.
2. FGD systems and SCR systems are designed for different purposes, making replication unlikely.
3. FGD systems are typically not designed to mimic SCR systems' functionality.
4. FGD systems and SCR systems have different operational requirements.
5. The construction methods used for FGD systems differ from those used for SCR systems.
6. The materials used in FGD systems are not the same as those used in SCR systems.
