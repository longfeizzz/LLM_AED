1. There is no indication that the persistence was out of protest.
2. The original statement implies that the rejection was the cause of the persistence, but the given context suggests that the rejection was a response to the persistence.
3. The statement implies a motivation (protest) that is not present in the context.
4. The context implies that the persistence was not expected or intended, which contradicts the implication that it was a deliberate protest.
5. The context does not provide any evidence that the persistence was a deliberate action, which is necessary for it to be a protest.
