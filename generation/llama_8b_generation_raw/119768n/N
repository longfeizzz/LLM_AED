1. The statement is too specific about the reason for persistence (out of protest), while the context only mentions that it persisted.
2. The statement implies a deliberate action (protest) by the subject, which is not supported by the context.
3. The statement's tone and connotation (implying a negative or critical action) are not present in the context.
4. The context does not provide enough information to determine the reason for persistence, making the statement's claim uncertain.
5. The context does not rule out the possibility of persistence due to protest, but it does not provide evidence to support it.
6. The statement's meaning is ambiguous without additional context, making it difficult to determine its accuracy.
7. The statement's claim (protest) is not directly related to the context's general statement (it persisted).
8. The statement introduces an additional layer of intentionality (protest) not present in the context.
9. The statement's phrasing (I rejected it as absurd but it persisted out of protest) implies a cause-and-effect relationship that is not explicitly stated in the context.
10. The statement's use of "but" implies a contrast that is not supported by the context.
