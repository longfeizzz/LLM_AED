1. The term "blocks" is ambiguous and might not be a standard unit of measurement for distance.
2. The term "blocks" may be referring to a specific type of block (e.g., city blocks, grid blocks) that doesn't align with the typical distance measurement.
3. The phrase "extends less than three blocks" implies a direction (towards the sea), but the statement doesn't consider this direction.
4. The word "even" in the statement suggests a direct comparison, which may not be applicable in this context.
5. The statement's interpretation depends on the reader's understanding of "blocks," which might not match the intended meaning in the context.
6. The word "even" in the statement could imply a comparison of the distance in both directions (from the tree-lined avenue to the sea and from the sea to the tree-lined avenue), which may not be relevant here.
