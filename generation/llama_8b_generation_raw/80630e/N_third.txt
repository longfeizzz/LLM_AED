1. The statement is an inference of the given information and the word "even" in the statement is ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways.

3. The given information only provides a lower bound (less than three blocks) and does not provide an upper bound, making it impossible to determine if the statement is true or false.
4. The word "even" in the statement implies a direct comparison, but the given information only provides a general statement about the distance to the sea.
