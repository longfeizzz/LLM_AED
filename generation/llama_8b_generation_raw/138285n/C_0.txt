1. The statement assumes a generalization based on two specific instances, but it's unclear if the speaker's emotional response is consistent across all animal killings.
2. The statement implies that the speaker cries in response to all animal killings, but the context only shows a reaction to horse and wolf killings, not other animals.
3. The statement may be false because the speaker's emotional response could be due to other factors, such as personal attachment or the context of the situation, rather than the animal killings themselves.
4. The statement might be false because the speaker's emotional response is not necessarily a result of the killings, but rather a reaction to the narrative or story being told.
5. The statement assumes a causal relationship between animal killings and the speaker's emotional response, but it's unclear if the speaker's emotions are a direct result of the killings or if there's a more complex emotional response at play.
