1. The statement is too broad, as it generalizes all animal killings, but the context only mentions two specific animal killings.
2. The context does not provide information about the speaker's emotional response to all animal killings, only to the two specific instances mentioned.
3. The context does not specify that the speaker cried due to the act of killing itself, but rather due to the death of specific animals.
4. The speaker may have cried due to other factors, such as the circumstances surrounding the death or the emotional connection they had with the animals.
5. The statement assumes a causal relationship between animal killings and the speaker's emotional response, but the context does not provide evidence to support this assumption.
6. The context does not provide enough information to determine whether the speaker's emotional response is specific to animal killings or if they would react similarly to other tragic events.
