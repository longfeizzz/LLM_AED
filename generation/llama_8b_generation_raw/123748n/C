1. The number "over two" implies a quantity greater than two, which contradicts the idea that there are many, which could be three or more, but does not necessarily exclude two.
2. The statement "over two" does not necessarily mean more than two, it could also mean exactly two or two and a fraction.
3. The phrase "at the present time" suggests a focus on the current moment, but the statement "over two" implies a comparison to a possible or potential future state.
4. The word "many" implies a quantity that is indefinite and potentially large, but "over two" is a specific and limited quantity.
5. The statement "over two" could be true if there are exactly two, which contradicts the implication that there are many.
6. The word "over" is often used to indicate a range or a margin, so "over two" could mean two or more, which does not necessarily exclude the possibility of there being many.
