1. Lack of information about the specific "such" in the context, making it unclear what "such" refers to.
2. Unclear time frame for "currently" in the statement, potentially differing from the "present time" in the context.
3. Inadequate information to compare the exact number of "such" in the context and "over two" in the statement.
4. Ambiguity in the meaning of "over two," which could be interpreted in multiple ways (e.g., more than two, two and a half, etc.).
5. Unclear whether "currently" in the statement implies a more specific or general time frame than "at the present time" in the context.
6. Lack of information about the criteria for counting "such," making it difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement.
7. Unclear whether the statement is referring to the same "such" as the context, potentially leading to a mismatch in the comparison.
