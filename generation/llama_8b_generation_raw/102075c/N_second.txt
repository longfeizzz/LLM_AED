1. The statement is a separate entity from the context, making it difficult to establish a relationship.
2. The context and statement appear to be discussing different topics (weather conditions in the first and the presence of ice in the second).
3. The statement does not directly relate to the context, which seems to be confirming the presence of ice.
4. The statement's "heat wave" contradicts the implication of the context that ice is present.
