1. Ca'daan's grunt was loud enough to be heard by the Kal.
2. The grunt was transmitted through the air and reached the Kal.
3. The Kal's hearing range is extensive enough to pick up Ca'daan's grunt from a distance.
4. The context implies the Kal is a living being that can hear sounds, so it's reasonable to assume the Kal heard Ca'daan's grunt.
