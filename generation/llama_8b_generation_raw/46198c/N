1. The statement is too absolute, as it uses "certain" which implies a 100% guarantee, but the context only suggests a determination of the return on investment.
2. The context does not provide enough information to support the statement, as it only discusses the potential outcome based on effective management.
3. The statement is based on the outcome of effective management, not the management itself, so it's not directly supported by the context.
4. The statement assumes a negative outcome, but the context only discusses the potential for a good return on investment.
5. The statement is an evaluation of the outcome, not a prediction or a guarantee, which is not supported by the context.
