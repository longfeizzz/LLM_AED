1. Ambiguity in temporal duration, as 'forever' can imply an infinite time or an excessively long time, but the statement only explicitly mentions a duration.
2. Lack of shared temporal reference, as 'forever' is subjective and 'too long' is relative.
3. Insufficient information to determine the exact duration, as 'forever' is a vague term.
4. Different connotations of 'forever' and 'too long', as 'forever' implies an indefinite duration, whereas 'too long' implies a duration that exceeds a certain threshold.
5. Contextual dependence, as the interpretation of 'forever' and 'too long' depends on the specific context in which they are used.
