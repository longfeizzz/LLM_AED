3. The statement ignores the potential benefits of competition in the delivery market, such as driving innovation and reducing prices.
4. The statement suggests that nationalizing all delivery services would be a cost-saving measure, which is at odds with the concept of a bottleneck function, where a single firm can be more cost-effective.
5. The statement implies that John Panzar believes in eliminating competition, which is not consistent with his characterization of street delivery as a bottleneck function, where competition can drive down costs.
