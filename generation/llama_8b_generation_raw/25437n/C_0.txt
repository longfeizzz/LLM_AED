1. The context implies that Dorcas is being interviewed, which may not necessarily be related to her bravery.
2. The description of Dorcas standing in the boudoir with her hands folded in front of her does not convey a sense of bravery.
3. The description of Dorcas' grey hair and white cap is more suitable for an elderly woman, which may contradict the expectation of someone being well known for their bravery.
4. The tone of the conversation may be more formal or polite, and the use of the word "brave" could be a figure of speech rather than an accurate description of Dorcas.
