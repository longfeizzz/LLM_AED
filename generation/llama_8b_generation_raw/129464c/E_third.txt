1. The statement refers to a research method that can involve looking forward (prospective) or backward (retrospective) in time to analyze system redesigns.
2. The method allows researchers to combine individual case studies from different times and locations to gain a broader understanding of system redesigns.
3. The statement implies that system redesigns can be studied using various research designs, including those that look at the past or future.
4. The method enables researchers to synthesize findings from multiple case studies to inform system redesigns.
5. The statement suggests that system redesigns can be analyzed using a combination of prospective and retrospective approaches.
6. The method can be applied to redesign systems in various contexts and locations.
7. The statement implies that system redesigns can be studied using a case study approach that involves combining individual studies.
8. The method allows for the analysis of system redesigns over time, including both past and future changes.
