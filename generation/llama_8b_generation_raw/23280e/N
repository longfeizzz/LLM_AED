1. The statement is too broad and does not specify who the people are.
2. The statement is based on a generalization that may not apply to all sphinxes.
3. The statement does not provide enough context to determine if the guarding was for protection or some other purpose.
4. The statement implies a physical interaction between the sphinxes and the people, but the context only describes the physical properties of the sphinxes.
5. The statement assumes that the guarding was done actively, but the context only describes the sphinxes as guardian deities, which may imply a more passive role.
