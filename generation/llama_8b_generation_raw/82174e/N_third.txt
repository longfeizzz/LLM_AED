1. The presence of educational maps, photomurals, and stenciled treatises does not necessarily imply a high budget, as they could be simple or inexpensive materials.
2. The exhibitions' elaborate wall panels may have competed with the objects for space and attention, suggesting that the budget was prioritized towards visual aids rather than the objects themselves.
3. The statement assumes that elaborate detail is always indicative of a well-funded exhibition, which may not be the case.
4. The context does not provide information about the overall quality or value of the objects in the exhibition, making it difficult to determine the exhibitions' funding.
5. The use of the term "competed with the objects themselves for space and attention" implies that the elaborate wall panels may have overshadowed the objects, which could be a sign of misallocated funds.
