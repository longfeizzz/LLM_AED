1. The statement claims EIA used the standard technology assumptions to eliminate the AEO2001 reference case projections, but the context states they were used to develop the projections.
2. The action described in the statement (eliminating projections) is the opposite of the action described in the context (developing projections).
3. The context does not mention eliminating projections, only developing them.
4. The standard technology assumptions were used to create the AEO2001 reference case projections, not to eliminate them.
5. Eliminating projections would imply removing them, which contradicts the context where EIA used the assumptions to develop the projections.
