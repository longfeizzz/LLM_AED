1. The statement is about hydrogen-based approaches, but the context mentions sorbent-based approaches.
2. The context states that other sorbent-based approaches might be preferable, not hydrogen-based approaches.
3. The statement does not specify that it is referring to sorbent-based approaches, but the context implies that ACI is a sorbent-based approach.
4. The statement is about hydrogen-based approaches, but the context implies that ACI is the conservative assumption, suggesting that it might be the most developed or established approach.
5. The statement does not provide any information that would make it comparable to ACI, as it is not specified that hydrogen-based approaches are being developed for the same purpose as ACI.
6. The statement is not supported by the context, which does not mention hydrogen-based approaches as a potential alternative to ACI.
7. The context states that other approaches may prove to be preferable, implying that ACI is not necessarily the best option, but it does not provide any information about hydrogen-based approaches specifically.
