1. The statement is referring to hydrogen-based approaches in development, not sorbent-based approaches, which are mentioned in the context.
2. The context implies that other sorbent-based approaches might be preferable, but it does not rule out the possibility of hydrogen-based approaches being preferable.
3. The statement is a hypothetical consideration, as it mentions "may be preferable", indicating that the preference is not yet established.
4. The context does not provide information about the characteristics or performance of hydrogen-based approaches, making a direct comparison with ACI impossible.
5. The use of "may" in the statement suggests that it is a speculative or uncertain possibility, rather than a definitive conclusion.
