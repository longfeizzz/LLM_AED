1. The statement implies that luck is an external force that can be relied upon, which is not supported by the context where luck seems to be the result of Tuppence's recovery from her previous state.
2. The context does not provide any evidence that the situation is the result of luck, but rather a coincidence or a perceived inevitability.
3. The context implies a sense of inevitability or destiny ("meant to be"), which is different from the idea of luck being a random or external force.
4. The statement is based on a single instance, but the context does not provide enough information to generalize that luck is real.
5. The context does not support the idea that luck is a reliable or consistent force, but rather a temporary or circumstantial occurrence.
6. The statement is overly broad and does not account for other possible explanations for the situation, such as chance or circumstance.
7. The context implies that the situation is the result of Tuppence's own actions or decisions ("recovering herself"), rather than luck.
8. The statement is not supported by any scientific or empirical evidence in the context.
