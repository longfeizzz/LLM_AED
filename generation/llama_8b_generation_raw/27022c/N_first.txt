1. The statement is undetermined because it is a vague approximation, as "over $126" does not specify the exact amount.
2. The statement is undetermined because it does not mention the percentage increase or the fiscal year, making it unclear if the amount is indeed higher than required.
3. The statement is undetermined because it does not account for the full amount of $126,400,000, which is a more precise figure mentioned in the context.
4. The statement is undetermined because it does not provide any information about the Commission's costs in relation to the required amount in fiscal year 1995.
5. The statement is undetermined because the word "over" is ambiguous and could imply any amount greater than $126, rather than specifically referring to the amount determined by Congress.
