1. The context advises not to think, but does not specify whether all mental activity, including imagination or creativity ("crazy mind"), should be avoided.
2. The term "crazy mind" in the statement is ambiguous and not clarified or referenced in the context, so it is unclear if "thinking" as mentioned in the context includes what is meant by "crazy mind."
