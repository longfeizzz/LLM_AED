1. The context only mentions that Taksim Square, where the street ends, is lined with luxurious hotels, not that the entire street itself is luxurious.
2. There is no information about the street's own features or level of luxury; the description focuses on what is at the endpoint, not along the street.
3. The presence of luxurious hotels and a cultural center at the square does not necessarily imply that the street leading to it shares those luxurious characteristics.
