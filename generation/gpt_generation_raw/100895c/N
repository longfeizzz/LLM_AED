1. The context does not specify what constitutes a "resource," leaving ambiguity about whether every output indeed meets this criterion.
2. The context does not describe what is meant by "output," making it unclear if all outputs fall under the domain being discussed.
3. There is no information provided about the relationship between outputs and resources, so it cannot be determined if every output has a resource.
4. The context lacks details or examples to assess whether the statement universally applies.
