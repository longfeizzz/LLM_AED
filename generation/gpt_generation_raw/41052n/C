1. The statement "HCFA tried to keep everyone informed about the rules they were making" implies an effort to inform all relevant parties, but the context only mentions the publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which is a standard procedural step and does not necessarily demonstrate an active effort to keep everyone informed.
2. Publishing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking does not ensure that everyone is actually informed, as some individuals or groups may not access or be aware of federal register notices.
