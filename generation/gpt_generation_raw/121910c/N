1. The context mentions "a more precise picture" but does not state that the picture is accurate, so it is unclear whether "more precise" equates to "accurate."
2. The context notes that ancient writings give "only a romanticized view," which may conflict with accuracy, but it is not specified whether this means the overall depiction is inaccurate.
3. The context does not define what is meant by "accurate," and therefore the extent to which the writings are accurate or inaccurate is not established.
