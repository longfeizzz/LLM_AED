1. The context only states that it is "thought, but not known" that a lesser percentage of possible deliveries on rural routes are businesses, so the premise is not established as fact.
2. The context does not provide any information or evidence about why there are fewer business deliveries on rural routes.
3. The context does not mention people's preferences for living in cities versus rural areas.
4. There may be other unmentioned factors affecting the percentage of businesses on rural routes, such as economic, infrastructure, or zoning differences.
