1. The context compares something to a drug hangover but does not specify if it is worse, equal, or milder in effect.
2. The word "same" in the context implies equivalence, not a comparative degree of severity.
3. There is insufficient information about what aspect is being comparedâ€”whether the duration, intensity, or type of hangover is worse is not addressed.
