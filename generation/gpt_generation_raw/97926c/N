1. The statement says "almost a million dollars," but the context states $460 million, which is much higher; it is undetermined if the speaker is underestimating, rounding, or referring to a different incident.
2. The context attributes the losses specifically to strikes, while the statement refers more generally to "labor disputes," and it's unclear if all strikes are included within "labor disputes" as intended in the statement.
3. The statement doesn't specify the year, so it is undetermined if it refers to the 1997 event or a different occasion.
