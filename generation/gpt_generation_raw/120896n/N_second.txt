1. The context only mentions "scribbled words on the envelope" and does not reveal the content of the text, making it unclear whether the words refer specifically to a new will.
2. The context discusses the discovery of a will having been made, but does not specify that the discovery was made solely from the text on the envelope, so it is undetermined if the text alone revealed a new will.
3. The statement assumes the existence of a "new will," but the context does not make it explicit whether the will discovered was new or simply newly found evidence of an existing will.
