1. The context only mentions crying in response to the deaths of a horse and a wolf, which may not generalize to all animal killings.  
2. The context does not clarify whether the crying was specifically due to the fact that the animals were killed, or other emotional factors related to those particular scenes.  
3. There is no information about the person's reaction to other instances of animal killings, so it is unclear if this response is consistent across all cases.
