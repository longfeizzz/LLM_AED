1. The context states that "it cannot be outlawed," which means making it illegal is not possible, but the statement claims it "has to be made illegal," leaving uncertainty about whether the statement is discussing a legal requirement, a moral imperative, or simply expressing an opinion.
2. The context does not specify the subject ("it"), creating ambiguity about whether there might be conditions or exceptions under which "it" could actually be made illegal.
3. The relationship between the ability to outlaw something and the necessity to do so is not clearâ€”something that cannot be outlawed in practice might still be argued (in the statement) as needing to be outlawed in principle, making the inference undetermined.
