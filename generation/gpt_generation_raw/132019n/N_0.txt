1. The context states that Herb Williams "just doesn't have the offensive skills" in comparison to Tarpley, but it does not explicitly compare their offensive abilities or definitively say that Tarpley is better; the judgment is implied but not directly stated, making the exact relationship undetermined.
2. The context does not provide specific evidence or examples of Tarpley's offensive skills, only implying a difference without establishing it as a fact.
3. The context is based on the speakerâ€™s perception ("i guess sort of was supposed to take the place..."), introducing subjectivity and potential bias that prevents a definitive conclusion.
