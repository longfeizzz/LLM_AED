1. The context discusses the scenario where the surplus is saved, not lost, so the effect of losing the surplus on GDP per capita is not addressed.
2. The impact on GDP per capita when the surplus is lost could differ from when it is saved; losing the surplus might decrease GDP per capita even further or have a different effect altogether.
3. No quantitative information is given about the magnitude of the surplus or the economic mechanisms involved in losing it, so the specific outcome for GDP per capita in that case is unknown.
