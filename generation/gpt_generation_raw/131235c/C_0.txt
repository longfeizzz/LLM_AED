1. The context discusses the outcome if the entire surplus were saved, but the statement changes this to the entire surplus being lost, which would likely lead to a far worse outcome for GDP per capita.
2. Saving the surplus implies a positive contribution to economic growth, while losing it implies a negative impact; therefore, the effect on GDP per capita would be significantly different in each scenario.
3. The context indicates that even the most optimistic scenario (saving the entire surplus) only marginally fails to meet the doubling rate, whereas losing the surplus would presumably cause GDP per capita growth to fall much further below the historical average.
