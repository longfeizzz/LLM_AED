1. The exact number of correlated entities differs between the context and the statement (five vs. six), so there is insufficient information to determine whether six are correlated.
2. The correlation is specified for different seasons ("summer" in the context and "winter" in the statement), so it is unclear if the same or different entities are involved in correlation during different seasons.
3. The geographic locations ("some areas" vs. "certain areas") may or may not overlap, leaving uncertainty about whether the correlation in one scenario applies to the other.
