1. The context suggests agreement with the idea that "it's heavy when it's self propelled," but it does not explicitly confirm that heaviness is exclusive to the self-propelled state.
2. There is no information in the context specifying who is "wondering," so the assumption about the listener's state of curiosity is not justified.
3. The context does not clarify precisely what "it" refers to, nor if the reference is the same in both the context and statement.
