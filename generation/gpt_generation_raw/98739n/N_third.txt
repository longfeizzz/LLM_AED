1. The context mentions a sigh, while the statement describes him as saying something "sadly"; it is unclear whether sighing equates to speaking sadly.
2. The context notes that "the living is not equal to the Ritz," whereas the statement claims "the living is nothing compared to the glamour of the Ritz"; "not equal to" and "nothing compared to" may differ in strength of meaning.
3. The context does not specifically reference "the glamour" of the Ritz, only the Ritz itself, so it is uncertain if the comparison is drawn specifically to its glamour.
4. The context says "he observed," while the statement says "he said," making it unclear if he voiced the thought or merely thought it.
