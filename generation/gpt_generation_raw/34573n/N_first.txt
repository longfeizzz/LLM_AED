1. The context says "the door was locked," but the statement refers to "the door wasn't unlocked," which is a double negative and could create ambiguity in intent or meaning.
2. The context describes exclamations bursting "disjointedly," which does not explicitly confirm jumping up in a frenzy, leaving the group's physical reaction undetermined.
3. The exact wording of the exclamation in the statement ("wasn't unlocked") differs from the context ("was locked"), making it unclear if the exclamation was phrased as in the statement.
4. The context does not specify whether all individuals exclaimed together or how coordinated their actions were, so it is not clear if everyone jumped up or acted "chaotically."
