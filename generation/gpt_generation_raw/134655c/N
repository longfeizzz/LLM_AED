1. The context specifies the Academy of Fine Arts is on the southeast corner of the Maidan, but does not provide information about the location of "Northern Maidan," so the spatial relationship between the southeast corner and the north of the Maidan is unclear.
2. The context does not define the boundaries or extent of the Maidan, so it is undetermined whether the southeast corner can also be considered as part of the northern region.
