1. The phrase "about $273 billion" is approximate and may not represent an exact $6 billion increase from $267 billion.
2. The figures given are for "national defense," but it's possible that accounting methods or budget categorization could change, affecting the interpretation of the increase.
3. The context references projected future spending ("by 2002"), which may change due to unforeseen events or adjustments before that year.
4. The current figure ("$267 billion now") may not refer to the same fiscal period or precise baseline as used for the 2002 projection, making direct comparison uncertain.
