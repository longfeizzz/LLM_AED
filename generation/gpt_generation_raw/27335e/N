1. "That type of music" in the context may not refer to the exact same meaning as "that genre of music" in the statement.
2. The context questions the availability of the music, while the statement questions its continued existence or relevance, which are not necessarily equivalent.
3. The context does not specify whether "available" means being produced, being popular, or simply accessible, leading to ambiguity in matching the intent of the statement.
