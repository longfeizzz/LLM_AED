1. The context refers to "mail pieces lost to alternative bill-paying methods," which means mail volume lost due to people choosing other payment methods, not mail physically lost. The statement refers to mail physically being lost, creating ambiguity about whether the two are referring to the same type of loss.
2. The context only comments on the volume of mail affected by alternative bill payment, not the frequency with which mail is physically lost, so it provides no information about how often mail gets lost during delivery.
