1. The context refers to "Boca da Corrida Encumeada" as a route or trail, not a "text," so it is unclear if the "moderate text" in the statement is referring to the same thing.
2. The duration of 5 hours in the context is associated with an activity (likely hiking), not with reading or completing a text, so it is undetermined whether the statement correctly describes the duration of completing a text.
