1. Net cost for college programs is a financial calculation, not a method for increasing productivity; it is a measure of expenses minus revenues, not an intervention or strategy.
2. Calculating net cost itself does not increase productivity; it is used for reporting and assessment purposes, not as a means to affect economic output.
3. The context requires net cost for education and training programs to be reported as investments in human capital due to their intent to increase or maintain productivity, but the act of calculating net cost does not directly serve to increase productivity.
