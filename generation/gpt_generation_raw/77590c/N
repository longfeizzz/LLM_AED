1. The context is a question, and the statement expresses a belief, making it unclear whether the statement is an answer, an assumption, or unrelated.
2. The context lacks information about the referent of "that," so it is unknown if the speaker's belief is about the same thing mentioned in the context.
3. The context does not confirm or deny whether most states actually have "that," so the truth of the statement is indeterminate.
4. The context does not indicate the identity or authority of the speaker asserting the statement, leaving uncertainty about their knowledge or reliability.
