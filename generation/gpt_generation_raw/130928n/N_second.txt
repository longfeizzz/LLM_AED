1. The context does not specify what "that" refers to, so it is unclear what needs to be "got over" or if it involves ignoring something.
2. "Got over" could imply dealing with or overcoming something rather than ignoring it, so the relationship is ambiguous.
3. The context does not mention or imply the existence of multiple things, as the statement suggests ("some things"), but rather refers to a singular issue ("that").
4. There is no explicit mention or suggestion of the act of ignoring in the context.
