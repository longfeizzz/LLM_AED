1. The context mentions close ties with Britain and the Commonwealth but does not mention the United States, so there is insufficient information to determine if the party sought ties with the United States.

3. The absence of information about relations with countries outside the Commonwealth makes it unclear whether the party had any particular stance toward the United States.
