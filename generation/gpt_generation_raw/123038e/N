1. The context refers specifically to "attestation engagements," while the statement refers to "validation engagements," and it is not clear if these two types of engagements are equivalent or interchangeable.
2. The relationship between "reports on attestation engagements" and "details regarding validation engagements" is not established, so it is undetermined whether the requirement in the context applies to the statement.
3. The terms "reports" and "details" may not refer to the same kind or level of documentation, making it unclear whether the contextâ€™s stipulation applies to the statement.
