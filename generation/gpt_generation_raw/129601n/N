1. The phrase "Took forever" is subjective and does not specify an exact duration, so it is unclear whether it refers to a span of two years.
2. Without additional temporal information, "forever" could refer to a period longer or shorter than two years, making it impossible to determine if "Lasted two years" is accurate.
