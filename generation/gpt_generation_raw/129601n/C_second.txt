1. "Took forever" is a subjective exaggeration and does not necessarily mean the duration was exactly two years; it could have been shorter or longer.
2. Two years is a specific, finite amount of time and may not universally be considered "forever," which typically implies an indefinite or extremely long period.
3. The context does not specify any concrete time frame, so asserting "lasted two years" introduces information not present in the context.
