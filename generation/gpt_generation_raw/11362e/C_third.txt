1. The context says the volumes are available again now, not necessarily only after renovation.
2. The statement assumes the volumes will be available to the public after renovation, but the context does not specify their public availability post-renovation, only that they won't be returned to the stacks until then.
3. Availability to the public is not clearly established by the context; the volumes might be available in some other form or to a restricted group, not necessarily to the public.
