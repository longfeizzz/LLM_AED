1. The context only mentions "Candle grease?" without providing any additional information about what is being referred to, so it is unclear whether the statement refers to the same thing as the context.
2. There is insufficient context to determine if the question is being asked in reference to an event, object, or substance, or if it is answering or clarifying something.
3. It is not specified what "it" refers to, so we cannot determine if "it" was candle grease.
4. The context itself is presented as a question, not as a declarative statement, so no factual information is given to confirm or deny the statement.
