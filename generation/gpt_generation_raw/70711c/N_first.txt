1. The context suggests starting them in spring to avoid heat in summer, but it does not explicitly state that starting in spring will keep them cool during summer; it only implies that starting later would result in problems due to increased heat.
2. The context does not specify whether starting in spring guarantees the plants will be cool in the summer, only that starting in spring is preferable to starting later.
3. The context does not clarify what "them" refers to, so it is unclear if cooling in summer is the relevant goal for the subject in question.
