1. Insurance companies may deny claims for medical expenses if the patient was intoxicated at the time of the incident, as intoxication could be an exclusion in the insurance policy.
2. Insurance companies have a financial incentive to verify sobriety during incidents to reduce their payouts by denying claims related to alcohol intoxication.
3. Patient self-report follow-up is important because alcohol-related incidents may not be reported to insurance companies, potentially allowing patients to avoid claim denials related to intoxication.
4. Ensuring adequate follow-up helps insurance companies detect cases where intoxication could affect the validity of a claim, supporting their goal of minimizing unnecessary reimbursements.
