1. Section 414 imposes requirements that, if necessary, lead to pro rata reductions in basic Phase II allowance allocations, ensuring that allocations are adjusted fairly among all units subject to its requirements.
2. By mandating pro rata reductions based on the need to meet restrictions, Section 414 provides a mechanism that prevents any one unit from disproportionately benefiting or being disadvantaged, thereby promoting balance in allocations.
