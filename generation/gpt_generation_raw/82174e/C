1. The context attributes the elaborate details to NEH support, not necessarily to overall exhibition funding, so the apparent elaborateness could result from targeted grants rather than general wealth.
2. Elaborate wall panels and details may reflect prioritization of educational materials over funding level; sophisticated design elements do not always indicate ample funding.
3. The focus on elaborate wall panels that compete for space might suggest an emphasis on presentation rather than resource abundance, so the detail does not inherently imply well-funded exhibitions.
