1. The phrase "with some effort" is subjective and may not clearly quantify the degree of work involved, making it hard to determine if "some effort" equates to "some work."
2. The context refers to "a few things" that can be construed, but does not specify the actual amount or nature of the work required to do so.
3. The relationship between "some effort" and "some work" is not definitively established in the context, leaving it ambiguous whether they are equivalent in this case.
