1. The largest resort being 100 minutes away is consistent with the statement that larger ski resorts are 90 minutes away, as 100 minutes is still considered within the range of "larger" and can be interpreted as "around" 90 minutes away.
2. The statement about larger ski resorts may refer to multiple resorts, some of which could be 90 minutes away and one (the largest) slightly farther at 100 minutes.
3. "90 minutes away" could be an approximation, and 100 minutes would fit within a reasonable margin of error for such an estimate.
