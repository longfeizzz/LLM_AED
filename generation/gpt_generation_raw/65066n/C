1. The context only specifies that larger ski resorts are 90 minutes away, not that the largest resort is 100 minutes away.  
2. The statement contradicts the context by claiming a different travel time specifically for the largest resort.  
3. The context does not mention any resort being 100 minutes away, making the statement unsupported.  
4. "Larger ski resorts" could include the largest one, implying it should also be 90 minutes away, not 100.
