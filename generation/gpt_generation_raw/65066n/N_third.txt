1. The context specifies that larger resorts are 90 minutes away, but does not detail the travel time to the largest resort specifically, so it is unclear whether the largest resort follows the same travel time as other larger resorts.
2. The description "larger ski resorts" could refer to a group of resorts, while "the largest resort" may or may not be included in that group or could have a different travel time.
3. There is no explicit mention of the travel time to the single largest resort, so it is unknown if it fits within the 90-minute range or is an exception.
