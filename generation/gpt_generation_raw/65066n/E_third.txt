1. The largest resort being 100 minutes away is consistent with the statement that larger ski resorts are 90 minutes away, as 100 minutes is still considered within the range of "larger" and can be interpreted as "around" 90 minutes away.
2. "90 minutes away" could be an approximation, and 100 minutes would fit within a reasonable margin of error for such an estimate.
