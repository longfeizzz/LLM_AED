1. The context describes the gesture as gentle and affectionate, but not explicitly romantic, leaving the possibility of a romantic interpretation undetermined.
2. The context does not provide information about the intent or emotional context behind the gesture, so motivation (romantic or otherwise) cannot be definitively determined.
3. The described environment (reference to praying, blessing, and the presence of others) introduces ambiguity about the nature of the touch, making it unclear whether the gesture was romantic or platonic.
