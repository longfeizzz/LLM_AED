1. The context mentions that she was not "really much aware of what was going on" after her stroke, but it does not specify the severity of the stroke, so it is unclear whether it was "very serious."

3. Lack of explicit description of medical consequences or long-term effects leaves the seriousness of the stroke undetermined.
