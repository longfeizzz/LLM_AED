1. The context allows for professional clothes, which are not necessarily short skirts, so it is undetermined if she only wears short skirts.
2. The context mentions "revealing clothes or professional clothes (or perhaps both)" but does not specify the types of clothes within those categories, so it is unclear if all are short skirts.
3. "Only wears short skirts" is a stronger claim than the context provides, as the context allows for a variety of clothing within the categories given.
