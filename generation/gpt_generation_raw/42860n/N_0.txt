1. The context suggests a single reason ("That's why"), whereas the statement implies multiple reasons ("one of the reasons"), creating ambiguity about the number of motives involved.
2. The context uses "tried," indicating an attempt, while the statement uses "wanted," which refers to intention; the relationship between trying and wanting is not explicitly clarified.
3. The context provides no information about other possible reasons beyond the one mentioned, so it's unclear if there were additional reasons as implied by the statement.
