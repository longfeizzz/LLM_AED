1. The context contains an expression of guessing or uncertainty, while the statement asserts a true belief, so it is unclear if the speakers actually share the same level of conviction.
2. The context does not specify what the "prior situation" was, so we cannot determine if the speaker in the context is referring to the same evidence as the one in the statement.
3. The context includes dialogue (possibly involving two speakers), so it is undetermined whether the statement reflects the belief of the same person who spoke in the context.
