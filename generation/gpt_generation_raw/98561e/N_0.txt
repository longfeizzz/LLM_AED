1. The context does not specify what "it" refers to, making it unclear whether "bad" and "not good" are being applied to the same thing.
2. The context is a question rather than a factual statement, so the truth or falsity of "bad" is not established.
3. The relationship between "bad" and "not good" can be context-dependent; "not good" might not necessarily mean "bad" in all scenarios.
