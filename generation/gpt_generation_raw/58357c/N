1. The context does not specify if any changes occurred, so it is unknown whether the statement accurately reflects the situation.
2. The context could be asking about specific types of changes (e.g., physical, emotional, situational), but this is not clarified, making it undetermined if "nothing changed" applies to all aspects.
3. The question form of the context suggests a request for information rather than providing facts, so no evidence is given to support or deny the statement.
