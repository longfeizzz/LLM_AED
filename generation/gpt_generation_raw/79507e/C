1. Alignment of activities, resources, and goals does not guarantee success, as external factors (such as market conditions, competition, and regulation) can still lead to failure.
2. Organizational success also depends on the effectiveness and quality of execution, not just alignment.
3. Misaligned stakeholder interests or lack of support from leadership and employees can undermine success even if alignment exists on paper.
4. Unforeseen crises or risks (such as natural disasters or financial shocks) can prevent success regardless of alignment.
5. The organization's definition of success may involve metrics or outcomes that aren't achieved solely through internal alignment.
