1. "Prominent" and "well-known" may not be synonymous; an organization can be prominent in certain areas or for certain achievements without being widely recognized as "well-known."
2. The context does not specify that these were the only identified organizations, so there could have been other organizations identified that were not well-known.
3. Being "nationally known" does not necessarily imply being "well-known" to the general public; an organization could be known at the national level within specific circles but not broadly well-known.
