1. FGD systems and SCR systems serve different functions; FGD systems remove sulfur dioxide from flue gas, while SCR systems reduce nitrogen oxides.
2. The context discusses physical placement of equipment, not functional replication or technological mimicry.
3. Constructing FGD systems closer to the ground does not imply they replicate the design or operation of SCR systems.
