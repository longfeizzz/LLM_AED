1. The context does not specify what the Pope is suggesting about Gen, only that a suggestion is being made involving Gen.
2. It is unclear from the context whether Gen is being recommended, mentioned, or discussed in another capacity by the Pope.
3. The directionality of the suggestion (whether Gen is the subject or object of the suggestion) is ambiguous in the context.
4. The statement implies direct suggestion of Gen as a person ("Gen"), but the context may be using "suggesting that Gen..." as the start of a longer sentence or idea, leaving the intent incomplete.
