1. The context "Per week?" asks about the frequency within a week, while the statement "Every day" gives a daily frequency, but it is not explicitly clear if "Every day" refers to every day of the week or something else.
2. There is insufficient information to determine if "Every day" is a direct answer to "Per week?" or if it refers to a different time frame or activity not specified in the context.
