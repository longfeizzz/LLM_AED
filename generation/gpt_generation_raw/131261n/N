1. The context describes someone planning to drop a handkerchief or something similar as a signal, but it does not explicitly say that the purpose is for the listener to follow the person who exits the building.  
2. The context does not specify what action should be taken when the signal is given, only implying that "off you go" will occur, leaving the specific action ambiguous.  
3. It is unclear in the context who is meant to act when the signal is given, so the identity of the person being instructed is not explicitly established.  
4. The context does not directly state that the person who is being watched for is to be followed after the signal, so the intention to follow is not unambiguously confirmed.
