1. The context suggests that the speaker will give a visual signal ("drop a handkerchief or something") when the person comes out of the building, not necessarily that the listener should follow the man, only that action should be taken "off you go" which could be interpreted differently.
2. The statement specifies "watch for the signal," but the context does not explicitly mention watching; it only discusses giving a signal, possibly implying a physical cue rather than needing to be visually observed.
3. The context does not state directly that the desired action after the signal is to follow the person, only that the listener should go after the signal is given.
