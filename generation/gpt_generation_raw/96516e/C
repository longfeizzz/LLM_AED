1. The statement only says that Kidder decided not to write a book about Tommy O'Connor, but it does not confirm whether a book about Tommy O'Connor was written by someone else.
2. The phrasing "must have decided not to write" indicates intention or decision, but does not guarantee the outcome; it is possible the book was written despite the decision.
3. The statement conflates the author's decision with the actual existence of a book, but the context does not rule out the possibility that a book exists through other means or authors.
