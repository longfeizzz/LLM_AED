1. AC usage for mercury control is described as being roughly proportional to the total MWe of equipped coal-fired facilities, not higher than it.  
2. There is no indication that AC usage can exceed the total electricity generation capacity (MWe) of the facilities; rather, AC usage correlates to it based on a set proportion.  
3. The context assumes a direct relationship dependent on facility capacity and an 85% capacity factor, making it implausible for AC usage to surpass the total MWe.
