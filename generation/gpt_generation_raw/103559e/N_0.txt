1. The context specifies gin, vermouth, and a twist as the components, but the statement omits the twist, so it’s unclear if a martini must be only gin and vermouth or if the twist is also essential.
2. The context uses the term “should,” which implies recommendation, not necessity, while the statement uses “must,” indicating a requirement; it is undetermined whether the context intends the ingredients as an absolute requirement.
