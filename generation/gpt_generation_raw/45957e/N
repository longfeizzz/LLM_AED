1. The context states that Bauerstein had been at Styles, not that Styles was at Bauerstein, so it is unclear if the statement is addressing the same facts.
2. The statement interprets someoneâ€™s reaction ("That alters everything") without clarifying what specifically alters everything, making the link ambiguous.
3. The context does not specify that the presence of Styles at Bauerstein is relevant or mentioned, leaving the impact of such a fact undetermined.
