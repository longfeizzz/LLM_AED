1. Tommy is the one offering the bait (the draft treaty), not the one taking it.
2. The draft treaty is described as being used by Tommy to entice someone else, implying Tommy is not the target of the bait.
3. The statement incorrectly implies Tommy is being deceived or lured by his own bait, which contradicts the context.
