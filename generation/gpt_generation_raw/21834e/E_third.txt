1. The phrase "not run for the edification of tourists" indicates that the world does not exist to educate, improve, or benefit tourists specifically, implying there is no intent to cater to their moral interests.
2. "Edification" inherently involves moral or intellectual improvement, so a lack of focus on tourists' edification means there is no attempt to morally serve or be subject to tourists.
3. The statement follows logically from the context, as not seeking tourists' edification encompasses not morally subjecting the world to their interests.
