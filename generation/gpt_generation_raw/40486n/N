1. The context provides only information about staffing (having a full-time attorney), but does not directly state or provide evidence about the usefulness of The Women's Haven in the community.  
2. It is possible to have a full-time attorney without being a useful resource; no impact or effectiveness metrics are given.  
3. The term "useful resource" is subjective and the context does not clarify how the services are received or their effectiveness for the community.  
4. There is no information about community needs or comparison to other resources, so the actual utility of the Haven is undetermined.
