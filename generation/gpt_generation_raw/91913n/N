1. The context states eggshell worship is "one of the reasons," not the sole reason, so the statement's implication that eggshell worship is the reason is not determinable.
2. The context does not clarify if Dave's question occurs before or after the group's recognition of weakness, making the sequence of events between eggshell worship being identified as a cause and Dave asking about it undetermined.
3. The context does not establish a direct causal link between eggshell worship and the group's weakness beyond it being a contributing factor, leaving the extent of its influence ambiguous.
