1. The context states that Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney's character) is being forced out, but it does not explicitly say whether this means that George Clooney (the actor) is being fired from the TV show or if his character is simply being written off for other reasons.
2. Being "forced out" can refer to the character within the show's narrative rather than the actor's employment status; the actor might be leaving voluntarily or for plot reasons, not necessarily being fired.
3. The context discusses the fate of the character, not the terms of George Clooney's employment, so there is insufficient information to determine if Clooney is being fired.
