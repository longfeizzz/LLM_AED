1. The speaker says they "just started" about five years ago, suggesting five years ago was the beginning, not that "it had started" (which refers to an earlier point in the past before another past event).
2. The phrasing "I think" indicates uncertainty about the exact timing, so it is not definite that it specifically started five years ago.
3. The statement uses passive voice, implying something else started the event, while the context directly attributes the starting to the speaker ("I just started").
