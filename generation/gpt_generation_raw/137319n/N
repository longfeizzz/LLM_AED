1. The context only states that "she came to you," but it does not mention whether anyone asked if this happened.  
2. The context does not specify who is speaking or receiving, so it's unclear if there was a question about the woman's actions.  
3. The context makes a statement, but the target statement refers to a question being asked, and there is no information about any question in the context.
