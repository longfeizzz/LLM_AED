1. The context does not define what "victorious in the end" means, so it is unclear whether investors' valuation equates to actual victory for GM.
2. The context only discusses how investors valued GM, not the ultimate financial or operational outcomes for the company following the labor disputes.
3. There is no information about whether GM recovered the losses or achieved any specific goal related to the labor disputes.
4. The statement implies a definitive outcome ("victorious"), but the context only provides a snapshot of investor sentiment at a particular time.
