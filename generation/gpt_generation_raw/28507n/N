1. The context mentions the subject is "highly magnified," but does not state whether this magnification is obvious or plain to see.  
2. The context uses the term "magnified," while the statement uses "amplified," which could have a different meaning (e.g., increase in volume rather than size).  
3. There is no information about the observer's perception or ability to plainly see the magnification/amplification.
