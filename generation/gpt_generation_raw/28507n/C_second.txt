1. "Magnified" refers to an increase in visual size, while "amplified" refers to an increase in volume or intensity, not necessarily visual size.
2. The context describes a visual property (magnification), not an auditory or non-visual enhancement (amplification).
3. "Amplified" is not synonymous with "magnified" in the context presented, so the statement misrepresents the nature of the change.
