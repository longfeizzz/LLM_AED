1. The context only implies that the absence of ancient sites to protect is a reason diving was not banned in Mykonos, but does not explicitly state that protection of ancient sites is the reason for diving bans elsewhere.
2. There may be other reasons for diving bans in other places that are not mentioned or addressed in the context.
3. "After all, there are no ancient sites to protect" could be offered as an explanation specific to Mykonos, not as a general rule for all diving bans.
