1. The context mentions that a specific area and length of water bodies are "impaired" by mercury emissions, but it does not define what "impaired" means or specify the type or extent of impact mercury has.
2. The context does not explicitly state that the impairment is due to the direct release of mercury rather than other emission processes or sources.
3. The statement is general ("has an impact"), while the context quantifies impairment but does not describe whether all types of mercury release have impacts or what those impacts are.
