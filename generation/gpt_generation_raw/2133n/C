1. The tomb guardian only gives you access to a small circular catacomb, not a thorough tour of the entire catacombs.
2. The statement refers to a "tomb garden," which appears to be a mischaracterization or misspelling of "tomb guardian," who is the actual figure in the context.
3. The context suggests that the catacomb is barely worth exploring due to its limited visibility and extent, implying a thorough tour is not possible or provided.
