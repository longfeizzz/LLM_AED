1. The context only asks Jerry about having a favorite team but does not mention sports in general, so it's unclear whether Jerry follows any sports at all.
2. Having a favorite team does not necessarily imply that Jerry follows sports; he could have a favorite team for reasons unrelated to following sports.
3. The context does not indicate Jerry's response, so we do not know if he follows any sports from the information given.
