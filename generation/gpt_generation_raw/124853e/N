1. The context specifies the requirement for H-2A workers, but does not provide information about other types of agricultural work visas, so it is unclear if the statement applies universally.
2. The phrase "permanent foreign residence" in the statement may have a different legal meaning than "foreign residence which they have no intention of abandoning" in the context, so equivalency cannot be assumed.
