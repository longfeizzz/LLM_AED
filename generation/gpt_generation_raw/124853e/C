1. "Permanent" foreign residence implies an intention to reside indefinitely in the foreign country, whereas H-2A workers are only required to maintain a foreign residence with no intention of abandoning it, not necessarily in a permanent or indefinite sense.  
2. The requirement to maintain a foreign residence is tied to visa status (non-immigrant intent), not the nature of the agricultural work itself.  
3. Not all types of agricultural work visas require maintenance of a foreign residence; the statement generalizes beyond H-2A visas.
