1. High humidity does not necessarily imply warmth; high humidity can occur at various temperatures, including cool environments.
2. High humidity alone does not guarantee that conditions are sweaty, as this depends on both humidity and temperature.
3. The term “sweaty temperatures” is subjective and not directly defined by the presence of high humidity.
