1. The context only describes the Massabielle quarter as "picturesque" and does not mention anything about it being touristy.
2. A place being picturesque does not necessarily imply that it is frequented by tourists.
3. The use of "sometimes described" suggests that its picturesque quality is subjective and not widely recognized, which may indicate it is not widely known or visited by tourists.
4. The context lacks any information about tourism, visitor numbers, or attractions that typically draw tourists.
