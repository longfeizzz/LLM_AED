1. The context specifies a "yearly, stealth tax increase" as a consequence but does not clarify whether this is considered "horrific," so the severity implied by the statement is not established.
2. The context does not mention or quantify any consequences beyond the stealth tax increase, so potential additional negative effects alluded to in the statement are not confirmed.
3. The judgment of what counts as "horrific" is subjective and not defined in the context.
