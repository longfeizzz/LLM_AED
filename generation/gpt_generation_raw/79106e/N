1. The context mentions the woman rolling and drawing spears, but it is unclear if this involved being "in rotation on the ground" as stated.
2. The statement implies both individuals ("they") were grabbing their weapons while in rotation on the ground, but the context only describes the woman drawing spears and does not specify the horse or anyone else grabbing weapons.
3. The context does not clearly define who "they" refers to, leaving ambiguity about whether multiple people were involved in weapon-grabbing activities.
