1. The context indicates that a state had appeared on the northwestern Alpine frontier and was involved in the movement towards a united Italy, implying there was significant political and social interaction across this region, which would have been unlikely if the area were completely separated from Italy by glaciers.  
2. The mention of a new state appearing and leading a movement suggests that the Alpine frontier was accessible and not entirely blocked by natural barriers like glaciers.  
3. Historical evidence shows that regions on the northwestern Alpine frontier (such as Piedmont-Sardinia) were integral parts of Italian unification processes and not cut off by impassable glaciers.
