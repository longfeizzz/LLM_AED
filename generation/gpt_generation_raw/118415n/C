1. The context only states that John Panzar characterizes street delivery as a bottleneck due to cost advantages of single-firm delivery, but does not indicate any belief about nationalizing all postal services.
2. There is no mention in the context of nationalization or support for a government-run monopoly; the efficiency argument could apply to private firms as well.
3. Panzar's observation about costs does not necessarily imply support for merging all couriers and delivery services into a single entity.
4. The context refers specifically to delivery cost structure, not to policy recommendations or beliefs about how postal and courier services should be organized.
