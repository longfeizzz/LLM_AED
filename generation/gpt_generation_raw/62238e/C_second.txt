1. The context states that GAO "needs assistance to meet its looming human capital challenges," which implies the challenges are anticipated but does not confirm that a shortage of qualified personnel will definitely occur.
2. "Human capital challenges" could refer to issues other than a shortage, such as the need for new skills, succession planning, or adapting to organizational changes, not necessarily a shortage of qualified personnel specifically.
3. The phrase "needs assistance" suggests that action is being taken to prevent or address the challenges, so a shortage may be avoided entirely.
4. The context does not specify the nature, timing, or severity of the challengesâ€”meaning a shortage is only one of several possible outcomes.
