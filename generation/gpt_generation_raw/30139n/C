1. The context does not mention luck as a factor in obtaining the van; it only states the circumstances of the purchase (from an estate after the owner's death).  
2. The context implies the van was available for purchase due to the previous owner's death, not due to luck.  
3. There is no indication that acquiring a nearly new van under these circumstances was rare or unexpected, which would be needed to attribute the acquisition to luck.
