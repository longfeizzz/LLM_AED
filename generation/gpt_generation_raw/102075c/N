1. The context mentions "ice," while the statement refers to "sunshine and heat wave," and there is no information connecting the presence of ice to sunshine and a heat wave.
2. The context affirms something related to "ice," but does not indicate any weather conditions, making it unclear if sunshine and a heat wave are present.
3. The connection between the events (ice and sunshine/heat wave) is not explicitly established, so it is undetermined if the ice situation is happening during sunshine and a heat wave.
