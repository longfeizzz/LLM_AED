1. "The questions" in the context implies multiple questions are under consideration, and "may need to be tailored" suggests that this adjustment could apply to many or most of them, supporting the claim that a majority would be affected.
2. The phrase "may need to be tailored" is open-ended, but does not exclude the possibility that it applies to the majority, making the statement consistent with the context.
3. If tailoring is necessary for the questions, and there is no indication that only a minority are exempt, it is reasonable to infer that more than half (a majority) might require tailoring.
