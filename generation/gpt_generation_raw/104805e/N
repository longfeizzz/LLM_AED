1. The word "high" in the context could refer to geographical elevation, emotional state, or drug use, while "hyped up" specifically refers to excitement or exaggerated promotion, making the connection between the two uncertain.
2. "High" and "hyped up" are not direct synonyms and can represent different conditions, so it's unclear if one implies the other in this context.
3. The context does not specify whether "high" is being used figuratively or literally, whereas the statement assumes a figurative sense related to excitement or publicity, leading to ambiguity.
