1. The context only mentions that the games are "fun to watch," not that the games themselves are inherently "a lot of fun," which could refer to playing rather than watching.
2. The statement uses the phrase "a lot of fun," which is a stronger and broader claim than just "fun to watch," leaving uncertainty about the degree of fun or the aspect being described.
3. The context does not specify whose opinion is being reported, so it's unclear if the statement generalizes beyond the speaker's personal experience.
