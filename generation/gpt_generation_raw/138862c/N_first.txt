1. The context discusses sorbent-based approaches, not hydrogen-based approaches, so it does not provide information about hydrogen-based methods.
2. There is no mention of ACl in the context; the context refers to ACI, so the relationship between hydrogen-based approaches and ACl is undetermined.
3. The preference for hydrogen-based approaches over ACl is not addressed or implied by the information given in the context.
