1. The context refers to government accounting practices, but the statement mentions "General Mills," which is a private company, making it unclear if the context applies.
2. It is not specified whether General Mills is the collecting entity or the recipient of the nonexchange revenue, leading to ambiguity.
3. The source and nature of the "nonexchange revenue" in relation to General Mills are not described, so the relationship is undetermined.
