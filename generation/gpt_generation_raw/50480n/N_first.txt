1. The context claims the subject will find "it all right," which suggests adequacy, but the statement goes further by claiming "more than adequate," so it's unclear if "all right" actually implies "more than adequate."
2. The context does not provide enough information about the subject's standards of adequacy, making it unclear if "all right" would equate to "more than adequate."
3. The term "all right" can be interpreted as merely sufficient or acceptable, which does not necessarily mean "more than adequate," thus the exact level of adequacy remains undetermined.
