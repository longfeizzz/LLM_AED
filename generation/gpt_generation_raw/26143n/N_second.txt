1. The context describes the associated cost as specific expenses related to assessing and collecting duties (e.g., salaries, paperwork processing), not as a measure of how much people spend relative to this amount.
2. The context does not provide information about how much people spend or any relative spending amounts, leaving the relationship between spending and associated cost unclear.
3. There is no information in the context equating "associated cost" with a ratio or comparison to spending, so it's undetermined whether this interpretation of associated cost is accurate.
