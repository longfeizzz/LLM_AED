1. The context specifies that the constraint is due to bondage, not folk tales and traditions, so it is undetermined whether folk tales and traditions are constraining.  
2. The context describes folk tales and traditions as aspects of a rich culture, not as sources of constraint, leaving it unclear if they are constraining.  
3. The statement asserts a present-tense universal claim ("clearly are constrained"), but the context does not provide evidence for or against this claim regarding folk tales and traditions specifically.
