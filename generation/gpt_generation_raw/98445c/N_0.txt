1. The context lists multiple reforms and goals (e.g., civil rights, free trade unions, release of prisoners, anti-corruption) rather than focusing solely on increasing power to presidential electors, so it is unclear if empowering electors alone is sufficient or prioritized.

3. The context does not explicitly mention increasing power to presidential electors as a proposed solution, so it is unclear if this aligns with the intentions outlined.
