1. The context states that writers are "no longer allowed the kind of license he took," but does not specify what "license" refers to—whether it means creative license, lack of fact-checking, or something else—so the exact requirement for newspaper writers now is unclear.
2. The context does not state directly that being more factual and careful is required; it only mentions a change in what is allowed.
3. The phrase "these days" in both the context and statement refers to the present, but without explicit details about what constitutes current expectations for newspaper writers.
4. It's possible that the restriction is about style, opinion, or other forms of expression, not strictly about being factual and careful.
