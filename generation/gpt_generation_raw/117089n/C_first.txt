1. "Agency representatives" does not necessarily mean "agency workers," as representatives could be managers or spokespeople, not the workers who perform technical tasks.
2. The context mentions "help resolve," which is a general term, while the statement specifies "help fix my security system," which is more specific and may not be implied.
3. There is no mention in the context that the issue involves a security system, so it is not clear that the help provided would address this specific problem.
