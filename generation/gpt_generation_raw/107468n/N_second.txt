1. The context only indicates that walking through "it" is required, not that it is necessarily the best way, so other methods could exist that are better but not mentioned.
2. The context does not provide any comparison to alternate ways of getting through "it," so it is unknown whether walking is superior to other possible methods.
3. The context does not specify why walking is necessary, leaving open the possibility that walking is required due to external constraints, not because it is optimal.
