1. The context states he was crying as if his mother had "walloped" him, which implies a strong or forceful action, whereas being hit with a spoon may not carry the same level of severity or force.
2. The term "walloped" does not specify the object used, so assuming a spoon was involved is not supported by the context.
3. "Walloped" can refer to being struck in a variety of ways, not limited to being hit with a spoon; substituting "hit him with a spoon" makes a specific assumption absent from the context.
