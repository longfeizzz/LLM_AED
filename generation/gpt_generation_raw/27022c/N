1. The statement refers to "$126" without specifying the units or scale, making it unclear whether it means $126, $126 thousand, $126 million, etc., so it cannot be definitively determined if it matches "$126,400,000".
2. The context states exactly "$126,400,000", so whether "over $126" includes or excludes this specific amount is ambiguous due to the lack of specificity in the statement.
