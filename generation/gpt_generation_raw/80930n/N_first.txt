1. The context suggests uncertainty or multiple possible factors ("education or or something like that"), while the statement asserts education as the sole decisive factor, so it is unclear whether the speaker agrees education is exclusively what matters.
2. The context does not specify if "you think" reflects the speakerâ€™s own belief or is merely a prompt for further discussion, so the connection to the statement is ambiguous.
