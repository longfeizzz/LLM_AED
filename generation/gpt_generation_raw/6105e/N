1. The context mentions that Jim Nicholson "invoked what is apparently the party-line inclusive party" but does not specify what he actually said about abortion, leaving the content of his answer unclear.  
2. The context suggests he referenced party inclusivity rather than explicitly giving the standard answer on abortion, so it is undetermined whether his response matched the party's standard answer.
3. The phrase "apparently the party-line" introduces ambiguity about whether what he said truly reflects the standard party answer on abortion.
