1. Warmer temperatures may hinder seed germination and plant growth.
2. Colder temperatures can help to slow down the growth of weeds and pests that might compete with the plants.
3. Some plants require a period of cold temperatures to break dormancy and initiate growth.
4. Colder weather can reduce water loss through transpiration, making it easier for young plants to establish themselves.
5. Planting in colder conditions may reduce the risk of fungal diseases that thrive in warmer temperatures.
6. Colder temperatures can help to reduce soil-borne diseases that might affect the newly planted seeds.
7. Some plants have a natural dormancy period that is triggered by cold temperatures, which can help them survive the winter and grow stronger in the spring.
