1. The statement is true because it specifies the largest resort, not the average or typical ski resort, and the larger ski resorts are indeed 90 minutes away, making the largest one 10 minutes farther.
2. The statement is true because the context only states that larger ski resorts are 90 minutes away, not that they are all 90 minutes away, and the largest one is an exception.
3. The statement is true because it provides a specific and accurate measurement (100 minutes) for the largest resort, which might be different from the general statement (90 minutes) for larger ski resorts.
4. The statement is true because the context does not imply that all ski resorts are within a 90-minute drive, only that larger ones are, and the largest one is not considered larger in this context.
