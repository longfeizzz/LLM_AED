1. The statement contradicts the information provided in the context, but the context only states that "larger" ski resorts are 90 minutes away, not all or the largest.
2. The statement provides a specific example, but the context does not specify that the largest resort is the only one that meets the criteria of being larger.
3. The statement does not provide enough information to determine the relationship between the largest resort and the distance, as it only mentions one resort.
4. The statement does not specify what it means by "actually," which could imply that the 100 minutes is a corrected or updated measurement, but the context does not provide a basis for comparison.
5. The statement does not clarify if the 100 minutes is the driving time, or if it includes other factors such as travel to and from the resort.
