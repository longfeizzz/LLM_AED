1. The volumes are currently available, implying they can be accessed by the public already.
2. The renovation is for the library itself, not the volumes, so the volumes' availability isn't directly affected.
3. The statement assumes the volumes will be taken away from the public during the renovation, which is not explicitly stated.
4. The volumes being available doesn't necessarily mean they will be returned to the stacks after renovation.
5. The renovation could include changes to the way volumes are stored or accessed, making the statement incorrect.
6. The statement assumes the renovation is the sole reason for the volumes not being returned to the stacks, but other factors might be at play.
