1. The statement is false because it contradicts the assumption that AC usage is roughly proportional to the total MWe of coal-fired facilities equipped with the technology.
2. The statement implies a direct relationship between AC usage and MWe, but the given context suggests a proportional relationship, not a direct one.
3. The statement does not account for the 85% average capacity factor, which affects the actual AC usage.
4. The statement does not consider other assumptions in Tables 4-4 and 4-5, which might affect the relationship between AC usage and MWe.
5. The statement is false because it is the opposite of what the context suggests, which is that AC usage is roughly proportional to the total MWe of coal-fired facilities.
