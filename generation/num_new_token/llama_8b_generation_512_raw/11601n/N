1. The statement is comparing AC usage to MWe, which are different units and might not be directly comparable.
2. The statement contradicts the given context which suggests a proportional relationship between AC usage and MWe.
3. The given context assumes an average capacity factor of 85 percent, but the statement does not account for this assumption.
4. The statement does not provide enough information to determine if it's true or false, as it lacks specific data on AC usage and MWe.
5. The statement might be referring to a different time period or location than the context, making the comparison invalid.
6. The statement could be referring to a different type of AC usage or MWe than the one described in the context.
7. The statement assumes that all coal-fired facilities equipped with mercury control technology are always operating at maximum capacity, which is not the case.
8. The statement does not account for the fact that some coal-fired facilities might be shut down or in maintenance, affecting the total MWe.
9. The statement might be considering other factors not mentioned in the context, such as the type of coal used or the age of the facilities.
