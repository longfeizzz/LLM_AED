1. The average capacity factor is lower than assumed (85 percent), resulting in higher AC usage per MWe.
2. The total MWe from coal facilities is underestimated due to missing data or incorrect calculations.
3. The AC usage for mercury control is higher than the assumed values in Tables 4-4 and 4-5.
4. More coal-fired facilities are equipped with the technology than assumed, increasing the total MWe with mercury control.
5. The technology is more energy-intensive than assumed, leading to higher AC usage per MWe.
6. The total MWe from coal facilities includes both those with and without mercury control technology, but the AC usage only accounts for those with the technology.
