1. The statement and the context provide different units of time (years vs. an unspecified, but presumably shorter, time period).
2. The context implies a subjective experience of time passing slowly, which is not necessarily reflected in the objective duration of two years.
3. The context does not provide a clear basis for comparison to determine whether two years is a long or short duration.
4. The statement is too specific (two years) compared to the vague context (took forever), making it difficult to determine the relationship.
5. The context implies a general feeling of time passing slowly, while the statement provides a specific, quantifiable duration.
6. The context is too vague to establish a clear relationship between the duration implied by "took forever" and the specific duration of two years.
