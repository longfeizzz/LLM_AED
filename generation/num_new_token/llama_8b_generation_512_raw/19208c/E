1. The statement implies a restriction based on religion, which is not supported by the context of "Hearty Sabbath meals."

3. The context suggests a general description of meals, not a specific restriction based on religion.
4. Sabbath meals are often associated with Jewish culture, implying that the statement is likely targeting a specific religious group, not Buddhists.
5. The statement is inconsistent with the context, as Sabbath meals are not typically reserved for Buddhists.
