1. The follow-up test is longer, which could affect the observed toxicity.
2. The sample used in the follow-up test may be collected at a different time, potentially altering its level of toxicity.
3. The sample's level of toxicity may differ significantly between the range-finding and follow-up tests.
4. The observed toxicity in the range-finding test is not necessarily representative of the sample's true toxicity level.
5. The sample's toxicity level may change over time, making it unreliable to compare the two tests directly.
6. The conditions of the two tests may not be identical, affecting the results.
