1. The follow-up test is longer, which might allow for a more accurate measurement of toxicity.
2. The test may be performed with a sample collected at the same time as the range-finding test.
3. The level of toxicity might not differ significantly between the two tests.
4. The range-finding test is essentially the same as the follow-up test, with no differences in methodology or timing.
