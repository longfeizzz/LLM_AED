1. The statement is false because the governing body is not specified as global, only that the auditors are from another country, implying a national governing body.
2. The statement does not account for the possibility of national governing bodies that may be part of a global network or affiliation.
3. The statement does not consider the scenario where auditors are not required to report to a governing body at all.
