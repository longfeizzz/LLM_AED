1. The statement implies a single governing body that oversees all auditors globally, but the context suggests that auditors are subject to their respective country's laws and regulations, indicating multiple governing bodies.
2. The statement assumes a centralized governing body, but the involvement of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions suggests a more decentralized or cooperative approach to audit regulation.
3. The statement implies that all auditors are subject to the same governing body, but the context suggests that auditors from different countries may be subject to different governing bodies or standards.
4. The statement assumes a globally managed governing body is necessary for auditors from another country to conduct audits, but the context suggests that meeting local laws and regulations or acceptable standards is sufficient.
5. The statement is overly broad and does not account for the possibility that some auditors may report to a governing body that is specific to their country or region, rather than a globally managed body.
