1. The attackers will be coming from a wide area, spreading their forces thinly over a space as wide as the town.
2. The attackers will not be able to concentrate their forces, making their attack less effective.
3. The town's defenses can be prepared to face the attack from multiple directions, making it easier to defend.
4. The town's defenses can be spread out to cover the entire area, increasing the chances of detecting and repelling the attack.
5. The attackers will be unable to surprise the town with a concentrated attack, giving the town's defenders an advantage.
6. The town's defenses can be optimized for the specific area they need to protect, rather than being concentrated on a single point of attack.
