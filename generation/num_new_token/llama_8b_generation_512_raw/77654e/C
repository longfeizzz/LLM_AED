1. The statement is asking about dates, but the context mentions the absence of inscriptions and other things, implying the focus is on written or engraved information, not the presence of dates specifically.
2. The statement is not entirely accurate because it assumes "dates" refers only to written or inscribed information, when in fact dates can be determined through other means (e.g., radiocarbon dating, historical records).
3. The statement is too narrow in scope, as "dates" could refer to a wide range of temporal information, including but not limited to written or inscribed dates.
4. The context implies the absence of any labels or markings, but the statement is specifically about dates, which may or may not be present.
5. The statement is false because it's based on a misunderstanding of what the context is referring to.
6. The statement is not supported by the information given in the context.
