1. The statement is false because FGD systems have a different design and functionality compared to SCR systems.
2. FGD systems are typically constructed closer to the ground, whereas SCR technology retrofits are constructed higher up.
3. FGD systems and SCR systems serve different purposes in power plant emissions control.
4. FGD systems use different technologies to remove pollutants from flue gas compared to SCR systems.
5. FGD systems and SCR systems have different operational requirements and constraints.
6. FGD systems are designed to address specific pollutants and emissions, whereas SCR systems are designed for broader applications.
7. FGD systems have different maintenance and repair needs compared to SCR systems.
8. FGD systems are often integrated with other pollution control systems, whereas SCR systems are standalone units.
