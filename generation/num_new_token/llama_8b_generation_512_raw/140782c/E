1. The statement is false because FGD systems have different design requirements than SCR systems, leading to differences in construction height.
2. FGD systems have different components and configurations than SCR systems, which can affect their placement and construction height.
3. FGD systems often require more space and equipment than SCR systems, leading to a higher construction height.
4. The design of FGD systems is often driven by the need to handle specific pollutants and emissions, which can result in a different construction height than SCR systems.
5. FGD systems typically involve a different type of pollution control technology than SCR systems, which can influence their construction height.
6. FGD systems are often designed to operate at a different scale and capacity than SCR systems, leading to differences in construction height.
7. The materials and structural requirements of FGD systems can differ from those of SCR systems, affecting their construction height.
8. FGD systems often have a different layout and configuration than SCR systems, which can impact their construction height.
9. FGD systems are typically designed to handle different types of pollutants and emissions, leading to differences in construction height.
10. The construction height of FGD systems can be influenced by the need to accommodate specific equipment and components.
11. FGD systems often require different maintenance and access considerations than SCR systems, which can affect their construction height.
12. The design of FGD systems is often driven by regulatory requirements and environmental considerations, which can result in a different construction height than SCR systems.
