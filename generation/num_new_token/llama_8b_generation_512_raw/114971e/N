1. The statement is not about getting fired, but rather about not being killed off, which is a different consequence.
2. The reason for leaving the show is a temporary suspension (over the next two episodes) rather than a permanent termination.
3. The reason for the temporary suspension is a specific action (giving unauthorized painkillers) rather than a general reason like getting fired.
4. The statement is about George Clooney's character, not the actor himself, so it's about the character being written out rather than the actor being fired.
5. The statement implies a comparison to another situation (Jimmy Smits at NYPD), which is not relevant to George Clooney's situation.
6. The statement focuses on the context of the show (ER) and the reason for the character's departure, which is not directly related to the statement.
