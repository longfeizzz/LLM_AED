1. The statement is about the tips' ability to leave a scratch, but the context describes their shape and method of manufacturing, not their material properties or durability.
2. The context implies the tips are made for a specific purpose (knives used for slaughter), but the statement does not specify the intended use, so it's unclear if the fragility is relevant.
3. The term "fragile" suggests a lack of durability or strength, but the context does not provide information about the tips' material or construction, making it unclear if the fragility is relevant to their ability to leave a scratch.
4. The statement is a general claim about the tips, but the context is focused on their design and manufacturing process, not their overall characteristics or behavior.
