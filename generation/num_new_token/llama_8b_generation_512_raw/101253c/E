1. The statement is true because it directly states a fact that is supported by the context.
2. Ataterk's efforts in the 1920s to build nationalism in Turkey continued into the 1940s, so it's reasonable to assume he would still be trying to build nationalism in 1942.
3. The statement does not specify that Ataterk was successful in building nationalism in Turkey, but rather that he tried, which is consistent with the context.
4. The context implies that Ataterk's actions in the 1920s had a lasting impact, so it's likely that he would still be involved in nationalist efforts in 1942.
