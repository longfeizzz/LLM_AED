1. The statement implies EIA removed the AEO2001 reference case projections, but the context indicates they were used to develop these projections.
2. The statement implies the standard technology assumptions were used to eliminate the projections, which is contradictory to the context where they were used to develop the projections.
3. The statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship between using standard technology assumptions and eliminating the AEO2001 reference case projections, which is not supported by the context.
4. The statement implies the AEO2001 reference case projections were eliminated, but the context suggests they were developed using these assumptions.
5. The statement implies EIA's action of using standard technology assumptions was the cause of eliminating the AEO2001 reference case projections, which is not supported by the context.
