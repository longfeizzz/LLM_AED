1. The statement implies a percentage increase rather than an absolute increase, which is not calculable from the given context.
2. The context does not provide information on the current budget, only the comparison of the current and future budgets.
3. The context does not provide the starting point for the increase (the current budget), so it's unclear by how much the budget will increase.
4. The statement does not account for the fact that the budget will increase by a certain percentage, not a fixed amount.
5. The context does not provide information on the year the comparison is made from, making it difficult to determine the increase.
