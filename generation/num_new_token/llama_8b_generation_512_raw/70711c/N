1. The statement assumes the plants will remain cool, but the context suggests they will get too hot in summer.
2. The statement assumes starting in Spring will result in cooler temperatures, but the context states it gets too hot in summer.
3. The context does not provide a direct correlation between Spring planting and cool temperatures in summer.
4. The context implies that the temperature fluctuations are the issue, not the time of planting.
5. The statement is based on an unstated assumption that cooler temperatures in Spring are directly correlated with cooler temperatures in summer.
6. The context implies that the ideal time for planting is not specified, only that the current method is problematic.
7. The statement's premise is contradicted by the context's implication that the temperature issue is not resolvable by planting in Spring.
