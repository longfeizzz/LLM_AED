1. The statement contradicts the given context that a single firm can deliver at a lower total cost, implying John Panzar would not support nationalizing services.
2. The context suggests that nationalization might lead to inefficiencies, as it could prevent multiple firms from competing and innovating.
3. The statement implies that nationalization would be necessary for cost savings, but the context suggests that a single firm is already more cost-effective.
4. The context implies that nationalization would be counterproductive to cost savings, as it would eliminate the competition that drives innovation and efficiency.
5. The statement may be undetermined because it does not consider the potential trade-offs between cost savings and other factors, such as innovation, competition, and government control.
6. The statement may be undetermined because it assumes that nationalization is the only way to achieve cost savings, when in fact the context suggests that a single firm can already achieve this goal.
7. The context suggests that John Panzar values efficiency and competition, so nationalizing services might be inconsistent with his values.
