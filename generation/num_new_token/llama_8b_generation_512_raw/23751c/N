1. The statement is an assumption rather than a proven fact.
2. There is no direct evidence to support the claim that people prefer living in cities rather than rural areas as the reason for a lesser percentage of possible deliveries on rural routes being businesses.
3. The statement ignores the possibility that other factors, such as economic conditions or infrastructure, may contribute to the difference in business delivery percentages between rural and residential areas.
4. The statement assumes a direct causal relationship between urban preference and business delivery percentages without considering potential indirect factors.
5. The statement does not account for the possibility that the difference in business delivery percentages may be due to other factors, such as differences in population density or economic activity.
6. The statement is based on a generalization about people's preferences rather than data or evidence specific to delivery routes.
7. The statement is undetermined because it relies on an unsubstantiated assumption about people's preferences rather than empirical evidence.
8. The statement does not address the fact that the original statement only mentions a "lesser percentage" of possible deliveries on rural routes being businesses, which may be due to various factors, not just people's preferences.
