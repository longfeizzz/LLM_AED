1. INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) was replaced by USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) in 2003, so it's unlikely to be the agency that issued the guidance in 2000.
2. The Memorandum M0010 was issued by OMB (Office of Management and Budget), which is a different agency from INS.
3. The Memorandum M0010 was dated April 25, 2000, and the context mentions OMB, which suggests the guidance was issued by OMB.
