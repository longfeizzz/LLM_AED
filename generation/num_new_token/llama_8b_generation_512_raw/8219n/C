6. The chemicals are not naturally filtered out by the ground, but rather require additional processes.
7. The ground does not have the capacity to remove the chemicals from the water table.
8. The chemicals are not filtered by the ground, but rather accumulate in it.
9. The filtering process is not instantaneous, and the chemicals remain in the ground for a period of time.
