1. The Chinese calendar provided a well-established framework for calculating the year of foundation.
2. The use of the Chinese cosmological cycle, which is based on a long period, allowed for a relatively precise calculation.
3. The 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle is a specific and well-defined period, making it suitable for precise calculations.
4. The calculation was based on a known and consistent cycle, reducing the margin of error.
5. The Chinese calendar is a system that has been used for centuries, allowing for a high degree of accuracy in its calculations.
6. The use of a specific, well-defined cycle minimizes the potential for error or discrepancy in the calculation.
7. The calculation of Japan's year of foundation was based on a well-documented and widely accepted system.
