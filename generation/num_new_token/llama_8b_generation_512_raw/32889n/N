1. The statement implies a goal that is in conflict with the existing fact that there are already established exceptions in 31 U.S.C.
2. The statement is too absolute, as "all exceptions" is an unrealistic goal given the existing exceptions in 31 U.S.C.
3. The statement does not account for the possibility that the exceptions in 31 U.S.C. might be necessary or unavoidable.
4. The statement lacks context about what "they" are trying to eliminate exceptions for, making it difficult to assess the relationship between the statement and the fact.
5. The statement implies a level of authority or control that is not explicitly stated in the context.
