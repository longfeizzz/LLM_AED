1. Technology's impact on electronic commerce may lead to the automation of certain tasks, potentially reducing human oversight and control.
2. Expanding Internet applications may result in increased complexity, making it more challenging to maintain control over activities.
3. Changes in technology may require new control activities to be implemented, but this does not necessarily mean that control will be reduced.
4. The basic requirements of control will remain unchanged, so any perceived reduction in control is due to the changing nature of control activities, not their fundamental necessity.
5. The statement is false because technology will not make it so we have less control of activities; rather, control activities will change in nature.
