1. The Alpine frontier is not geographically synonymous with the Italian Alps, allowing for the presence of glaciers between the frontier and Italy.
2. The Alpine frontier is located on the northwestern part, implying that the majority of Italy is south and east of this area, where glaciers are less common.
3. Glaciers can be found in mountainous regions, and the Alpine frontier is a mountainous area, making it plausible for glaciers to be present between the frontier and Italy.
4. The statement does not specify that the Alpine frontier is directly adjacent to Italy, allowing for a separation by glaciers.
