1. The statement is false because David Cope is a professor of music at the University of California at Santa Cruz, not a specialist in Mozart's music.
2. The statement is false because the existence of a 42nd Mozart symphony is not verified or widely accepted.
3. The statement is false because the number of symphonies attributed to Mozart is limited (he wrote 41 symphonies).
4. The statement is false because Cope's claim may be based on a work of his own composition, not an actual lost or unknown Mozart symphony.
5. The statement is false because the claim of creating Mozart's 42nd symphony may be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of his work.
6. The statement is false because there is no evidence to support the existence of a 42nd Mozart symphony.
7. The statement is false because it is unlikely that a new, authentic Mozart symphony would be created without being widely recognized and verified by experts in the field.
8. The statement is false because the statement's wording, "Mozart's 42nd symphony," implies that the symphony is an actual work by Mozart, which is not the case if Cope created it.
