1. Historical context suggests that moral standards and social norms evolve over time, making Clinton's approvals less indicative of a new form of immorality.
2. The comparison of Clinton's approvals to past moral standards is anachronistic, as societal values and expectations have changed.
3. Clinton's approvals do not represent a sudden shift in moral values, but rather a continuation of existing trends and attitudes.
4. The idea that Clinton's approvals signify a new form of immorality is based on a static and unchanging definition of morality, which is unrealistic.
5. The statement ignores the complexity of human morality and the fact that moral standards can be context-dependent and subjective.
6. Clinton's approvals are not inherently immoral; they may simply reflect changing social norms and values.
7. The statement assumes that Clinton's approvals are a singular event, rather than one part of a larger historical trend.
8. The comparison of Clinton's approvals to other historical events or figures is flawed, as it oversimplifies the complexities of human morality and history.
