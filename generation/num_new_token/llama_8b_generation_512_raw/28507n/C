1. The statement assumes a type of amplification (amplified) that is different from what the context describes (highly magnified).
2. The context does not provide evidence that the amplification is of sound.
3. The statement implies a form of amplification that is not necessarily visual.
4. The context suggests a visual representation, but the statement is not specific to visual amplification.
5. The context does not provide information about the type of amplification, making the statement's assumption about amplification uncertain.
6. The statement's use of "plain for you to see" implies a level of clarity that may not be present in the context.
