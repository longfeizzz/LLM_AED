1. The statement claims the site is an ancient asteroid impact, but the context states it is the site of the ancient capital of the island, which suggests a human settlement.
2. The context mentions the third century b.c. and the Ptolemaic rule, which implies a historical and human-related event, not an asteroid impact.
3. Asteroids are objects in space, and impacts are events that occur in space, but the context describes a site on land, which does not match the characteristics of an asteroid impact.
4. The context provides specific historical information about the site, which contradicts the vague and non-historical nature of an asteroid impact.
5. The term "site of the ancient capital" is a clear indication of human activity, which is inconsistent with the idea of an asteroid impact.
6. The context does not mention anything about a catastrophic event that would be typical of an asteroid impact.
