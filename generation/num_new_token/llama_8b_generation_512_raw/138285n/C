1. The statement is too general as it implies that all animal killings make the speaker cry, but the context shows that this is not the case for both the horse and wolf.
2. The speaker only cried when the horse got killed, not when the wolf got killed.
3. The speaker cried when the wolf got killed, which contradicts the statement that animal killings make them want to cry.
4. The speaker cried when the wolf got killed, but it is not clear if the speaker is upset by the wolf's death or if they are crying for another reason.
