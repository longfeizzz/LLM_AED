1. The Kal grunt was loud enough for Ca'daan to hear it, and the sound traveled through the environment.
2. Ca'daan's grunt caused the horse to lift, and the horse's movement was close enough to the Kal for it to hear Ca'daan's grunt.
3. The Kal was in a position to hear Ca'daan's grunt, either directly or through a medium like air or another object.
4. The Kal and Ca'daan were in close proximity, allowing the Kal to hear Ca'daan's grunt directly.
5. The statement is false because there is no indication that Ca'daan made a sound, only that he heard the Kal grunt and felt the horse lift.
