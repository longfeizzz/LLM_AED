1. The statement mentions hydrogen-based approaches, but the context discusses sorbent-based approaches.
2. The context does not mention hydrogen-based approaches, making a comparison to ACI irrelevant.
3. The statement assumes hydrogen-based approaches are in development, which is not mentioned in the context.
4. The context implies that ACI is the current conservative assumption, not a preferable option.
5. The statement contradicts the context by implying that hydrogen-based approaches may be preferable to ACI.
