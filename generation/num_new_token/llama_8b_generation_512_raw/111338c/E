1. The statement implies that the gun was not used, which aligns with the action of throwing one and shooting the other, suggesting the gun was not drawn.
2. The term "kept" implies that the gun remained in its original position, which in this case is holstered.
3. The action of shooting does not require the gun to be drawn, as it could be done from the holstered position.
4. The context does not specify that the gun was drawn before being used, so it is possible that it was used from the holstered position.
5. The statement does not explicitly state that the gun was drawn, only that it was not used, which is consistent with the gun being holstered.
