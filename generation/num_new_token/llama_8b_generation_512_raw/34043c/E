1. The Trump Tower and the Gaiety Theatre are two different locations.
2. The Trump Tower is not known for its ornate decor.
3. The Trump Tower is not worth visiting for its ornate decor, but rather the statement is false because it implies the Trump Tower has some ornate decor.
4. The context does not provide information about the Trump Tower, so we cannot infer anything about its worth as a place to visit for ornate decor.
5. The statement is false because it is a negative statement about a place that is not associated with the context of the Gaiety Theatre.
