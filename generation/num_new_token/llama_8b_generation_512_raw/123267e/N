3. The context is a colloquialism, and the statement is a more formal interpretation, so the relationship is undetermined due to ambiguity in the context.
4. The context does not provide enough information to determine whether the person's dishonesty is the reason for being considered a "bad lot," so the relationship is undetermined due to lack of causality.
