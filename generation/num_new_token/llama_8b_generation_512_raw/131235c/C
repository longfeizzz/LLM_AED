1. The statement is false because losing the surplus would have a negative impact on GDP per capita, making it even more difficult to reach the U.S. historical average of doubling every 35 years.
2. The statement is false because losing the surplus would likely lead to economic contraction or stagnation, making it impossible to double GDP per capita every 35 years.
3. The statement is false because saving the surplus was the condition for reaching the U.S. historical average of doubling every 35 years, and losing it would negate that possibility.

5. The statement is false because the U.S. historical average of doubling every 35 years is a hypothetical scenario that assumes the surplus is saved, and losing it would make it impossible to achieve.
6. The statement is false because the condition of losing the surplus contradicts the premise of the U.S. historical average, which assumes the surplus is saved.
