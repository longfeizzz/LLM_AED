1. The air's warm temperature is consistent with arid conditions, which are often associated with warm air.
2. The arid nature of the air is implied by its warm temperature, as warm air tends to be dry.
3. Warm air can contribute to arid conditions by evaporating moisture from the surrounding land.
4. The air's warmth allows it to permeate the surrounding land more easily, which is characteristic of arid air.
5. Arid air often contains less moisture, which can allow it to permeate the surrounding land more easily.
6. The combination of the air's warm temperature and arid nature enables it to permeate the surrounding land.
