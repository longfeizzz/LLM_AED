1. The statement is contradicted by the context, which explicitly states they made little effort to convert local inhabitants.
2. The statement implies a successful expansion of territory, but the context suggests the opposite.
3. The context specifies "little effort," which implies a lack of effective action, contradicting the statement's implication of successful conversion and expansion.
4. The statement's claim of successful conversion and expansion is not supported by the context, which does not mention any successful conversions or expansions.
5. The context mentions the Jesuit presence but highlights its ineffectiveness, which undermines the statement's assertion of the Jesuit presence being beneficial.
6. The statement implies a direct causal link between the Jesuit presence and successful conversion and expansion, but the context suggests a lack of such a link.
7. The context provides a negative example, which makes the statement undetermined without additional information to confirm its validity in other contexts.
