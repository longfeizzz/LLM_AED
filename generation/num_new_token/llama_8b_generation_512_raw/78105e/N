1. The statement describes a situation already known from the context, making it redundant and not adding new information.
2. The statement implies a continuation of the situation from the context, but the context already describes the outcome of this situation.
3. The statement does not provide enough information to determine its relationship to the context, as "very low and hard to maintain" is a vague description that could apply to various situations.
4. The statement does not specify a time frame or a particular point in time, making it difficult to determine if it is referring to the same situation as the context.
5. The statement does not provide a clear contrast or comparison to the context, making it difficult to determine if it is true or false.
6. The statement is too general and could apply to many situations, making it difficult to determine its relationship to the specific situation described in the context.
7. The statement implies a lack of change or improvement, but the context already describes the outcome of the situation, which suggests that there was a change (abandoning the fort).
