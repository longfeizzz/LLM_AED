1. The statement implies that leagues are always present, but the context suggests that the speaker has only experienced this once or on multiple occasions, which might not be representative of all times.
2. The statement assumes that the presence of leagues is the sole reason the speaker cannot bowl, but the context implies that there might be other reasons, such as the leagues being the only option available.
3. The statement is based on the speaker's personal experience, but it may not be a generalizable truth, as the speaker has only tried to go bowling a certain number of times.
4. The statement is absolute ("Every time"), but the context suggests that the speaker's experience is limited, which might not justify such a strong claim.
5. The statement ignores the possibility that the speaker's attempts to go bowling might be at times when leagues are indeed the primary activity, but this is not the only reason the speaker cannot bowl.
6. The statement does not account for other possible reasons why the speaker cannot bowl, such as the leagues being too competitive or the speaker not being able to join a league.
