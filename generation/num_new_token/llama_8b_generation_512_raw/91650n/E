1. The weight of a self-propelled object is a direct result of its propulsion mechanism and the mass of the object itself.
2. Self-propelled objects often require more powerful engines or mechanisms, which contribute to their overall weight.
3. The added components for propulsion increase the overall mass of the object.
4. Objects that are self-propelled often require more robust structures to support the propulsion system, leading to increased weight.
5. The presence of a propulsion system necessitates additional materials, which add to the weight of the object.
