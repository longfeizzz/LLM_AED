1. The statement contradicts the information that well-designed studies report narrower uncertainty bounds.
2. The statement ignores the quality difference between studies, which affects uncertainty.
3. The statement is overly simplistic, as it fails to account for the variability in study design and quality.
4. The statement is inconsistent with the idea that studies of lesser quality have wider uncertainty bounds.
5. The statement fails to acknowledge the concept of uncertainty bounds, implying that uncertainty is absolute rather than relative.
