1. The action described is gentle and paternal rather than romantic.
2. The context suggests a familial or hierarchical relationship rather than a romantic one.
3. The old man's wheezy breathing and the prophet's Last whispered word repeated by the faithful create a sense of reverence and respect, which is inconsistent with romantic intentions.
4. The saint's action of pushing the narrator away and then straightening their collar and nodding them toward the door implies a paternal or authoritative gesture rather than a romantic one.
5. The description of the old man's chest smelling of dung smoke and cinnamon and mutton grease is unromantic and suggests a rustic or rural setting.
6. The presence of snake charmers and a blind thief seeking the saint's blessing creates a sense of chaos and disorder, which is inconsistent with romantic intentions.
7. The saint's prayer, which is left untranslated, may be a sign of his devotion to a higher power rather than a romantic interest in the narrator.
