6. The context does not provide information about the door's state before it did not budge.
7. The statement implies that the door being stuck is the reason for it not moving, but the context does not rule out other possible reasons.
8. The statement is based on a general assumption about the relationship between a door being stuck and it not moving, but the context does not provide specific information to support this assumption.
