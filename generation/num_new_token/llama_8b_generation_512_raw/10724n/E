1. The designs previously exclusive to royalty are now accessible to everyone, implying a broader market, which can lead to lower prices due to economies of scale.
2. The removal of exclusivity and royalty reserve may have led to increased mass production, reducing costs and making the designs more affordable.
3. The designs are now available to all, which could indicate a decrease in their perceived value due to demystification, making them more affordable.
4. The statement is false because the availability of designs to all does not directly imply a cost increase.
