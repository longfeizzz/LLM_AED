1. The statement implies a direct causal relationship between the designs being reserved for royalty and their cost, which is not necessarily true.
2. The statement is based on a past condition that no longer applies (royal exclusivity), so it's irrelevant to current purchasing decisions.
3. The statement fails to account for other factors that may influence the cost of designs (e.g., material, craftsmanship, production costs).
4. The statement is not necessarily true even in the past, as the cost of designs may not have been directly tied to royal exclusivity.
5. The statement implies that designs once reserved for royalty are still more expensive today, which is not necessarily the case.
6. The statement does not consider the possibility that the cost of designs has decreased over time, making them more accessible to all.
7. The statement is based on a false assumption that the cost of designs is determined by their historical exclusivity.
