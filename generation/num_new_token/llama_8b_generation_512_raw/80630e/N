1. The statement is a paraphrase of the context, but the context specifies "the tree-lined avenue" which may not be the shortest path to the sea.
2. The statement uses "even" which implies a comparison to something, but the context does not provide a basis for comparison.
3. The context specifies "less than three blocks" which is a specific range, but the statement only says "isn't even three blocks away" which does not provide a clear relationship.
4. The statement does not account for the possibility that the sea is more than two blocks away from the tree-lined avenue.
5. The context implies a specific location or perspective, but the statement is too general to determine its relationship to the context.
6. The statement uses "isn't even" which is an idiomatic expression that can be interpreted in different ways, making its relationship to the context uncertain.
7. The statement does not specify what "blocks" refer to, which could affect the interpretation of the statement in relation to the context.
