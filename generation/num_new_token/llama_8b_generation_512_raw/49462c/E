1. The explorer already named the village when he landed, so it cannot be named after him in the future.
2. The village was already named Sainte-Marie before the explorer's arrival.
3. The village's name was not changed to Sainte-Marie by the explorer, implying it was already known by this name.
4. The explorer's naming of the village was not a result of him settling there.
5. The explorer's actions (landing and naming) occurred on the same day, so he could not have settled before naming the village.
6. The explorer was attracted by the waterfalls and river, but there is no indication that he settled in the village, only that he landed.
