1. The statement is true because it is a direct rephrasing of the information provided in the context, with the two independent clauses reversed in order.
2. The context explicitly mentions that five percent of possible residential deliveries are businesses and that it is thought, but not known, that a lesser percentage of possible deliveries on rural routes are businesses, which directly supports the statement.
3. The logical connection between the two clauses in the statement is preserved, as the first clause provides a possible explanation for the difference mentioned in the second clause, which is also present in the context.
