1. The statement directly contradicts the given context by specifying a travel time of 100 minutes for the largest resort, which exceeds the stated 90 minutes for larger ski resorts.
2. The context implies that all larger ski resorts, including the largest, are within the 90-minute range, making the statement about the largest resort being 100 minutes away inconsistent with this implication.
