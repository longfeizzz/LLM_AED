1. The statement provides a specific example of a larger ski resort, implying that "larger" encompasses a range that includes the largest, and 100 minutes is within a reasonable margin of the given 90 minutes.
2. The largest resort being 100 minutes away does not contradict the statement that larger ski resorts are 90 minutes away, as "larger" does not necessarily mean "largest".
3. The 90-minute distance given for larger resorts is likely an approximate value or a general guideline, allowing for variations such as the largest resort being slightly farther away.
