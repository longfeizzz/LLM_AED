1. The context does not explicitly state the speaker's personal opinion or feeling about plastic, only that it is "too easy" which could imply a broader societal issue rather than a personal preference.
2. The phrase "that's the whole problem with it" suggests that the ease of plastic might be an issue, but it does not necessarily convey the speaker's personal experience or sentiment towards using plastic.
3. The context lacks a clear statement of the speaker's emotional or personal stance towards plastic, such as "I find" or "I think", which is present in the statement.
