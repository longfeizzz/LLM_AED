1. The statement does not specify what the horrific consequences are, so it cannot be determined if the consequences are related to the institutionalization of an underestimated CPI or the yearly stealth tax increase.
2. The context only mentions a specific consequence (a yearly, stealth tax increase) of overestimating how far the CPI is off, but does not provide a comprehensive list of all possible consequences.
3. The term "horrific consequences" is too vague to determine if it refers to the same consequence mentioned in the context or to other, unspecified consequences.
