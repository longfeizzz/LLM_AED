1. The context does not explicitly mention a bear, so there is no clear connection between the mutilated cheek and a bear.
2. The text only mentions touching and revulsion, implying a close and possibly disturbing injury, but does not provide information about the cause of the injury.
3. The word "mutilated" suggests a severe injury, but it does not necessarily imply an animal attack, let alone a bear specifically.
