1. The statement "It was clear" is ambiguous and could refer to different things, such as a situation, a decision, or the weather, without specifying what "it" is.
2. The context "I see" is a phrase that can be used to indicate understanding or acknowledgment, but it does not provide enough information to determine if something was actually clear.
3. The phrase "I see" can also be used sarcastically or idiomatically, which might not imply that anything was clear.
