1. The statement "There are many such at the present time" does not provide a specific quantity, making it impossible to determine if the number exceeds two.
2. "Many" is a subjective term and its interpretation can vary, potentially including quantities of two or less.
3. The context only confirms the existence of multiple items but does not offer enough information to accurately compare to the quantity "over two".
