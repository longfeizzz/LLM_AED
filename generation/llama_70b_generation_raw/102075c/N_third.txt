1. Lack of clear connection between the context and the statement, as "um-hum with the ice" implies a cold environment, while "With the sunshine and heat wave" implies a hot environment.
2. Insufficient information to determine the relationship between the context and the statement, as the context does not provide a clear topic or subject.
3. Ambiguity in the context, as "um-hum" is an expression that can indicate agreement or acknowledgement, but its meaning is unclear in this context.
4. The context mentions "ice", which is contradictory to the "heat wave" mentioned in the statement, making it difficult to determine a logical relationship.
