1. The speaker's admission of uncertainty ("I don't know what happened, exactly") does not necessarily imply a lack of coherence or clarity in their statement.
2. The context only provides a single sentence, which is a straightforward expression of uncertainty, and does not contain any contradictory or confusing information.
3. The speaker's statement is a clear and understandable expression of their lack of knowledge, and there is no apparent reason to conclude that they are not making sense.
