1. The speaker's statement is about their personal experience or opinion, but the context only provides a vague criticism of plastic without directly stating the speaker's personal feelings.
2. The context mentions "that's the whole problem with it", which implies the issue is not the ease of use itself, but rather a consequence of it, leaving the statement's determination ambiguous.
3. The context does not explicitly state "I" find plastic too easy to use, but rather "plastic is just too easy", which lacks a clear subject to confirm the statement.
