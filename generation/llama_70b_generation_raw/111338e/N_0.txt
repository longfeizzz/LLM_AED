1. The context does not specify what "one of them" refers to, making it unclear if "them" includes a gun.
2. The phrase "shot the other" implies an action involving a gun, but it does not directly state that he shot a gun, as "shot" could be used in a different context.
3. The statement "He threw one of them" introduces ambiguity about the objects involved and their relation to the action of shooting.
