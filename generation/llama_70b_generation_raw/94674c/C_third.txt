1. The WorldAid '96 Global Expo and Conference on Emergency Relief took place in 1996, not 2002.
2. The context specifically mentions that the event "took place last fall", implying it occurred in the recent past, which would not be consistent with a 2002 date if the context is from 1996 or shortly after.
