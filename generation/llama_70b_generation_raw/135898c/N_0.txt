1. The statement is undetermined because it occurs after the context, and the events described in the context may have changed the situation.
2. The context does not mention Hanson whispering or staring at the gears after the shout and the arrival of the rocs, making it unclear if the statement is related to the events described.
3. The phrase "The end is near" at the beginning of the context suggests a sense of impending doom, but the subsequent events do not necessarily confirm that it is indeed "all over".
