1. Rising and standing up are distinct actions, and the context only mentions Tuppence rose, without specifying that she was standing up afterwards.
2. The phrase "Tuppence rose" could imply that Tuppence got up from a seated or lying position, but it does not necessarily mean she stood up, as she could have risen to a different position, such as kneeling.
3. The context does not provide information about Tuppence's final position or action after rising, so it cannot be inferred that she stood up.
