1. The tone of "You did, didn't you?" implies an accusation, suggesting the action was intentional.
2. The context implies a level of certainty about the action having been taken, which contradicts the idea of it being unintentional.
3. The follow-up question "did you?" in both sentences implies a challenge to the person's intentions or actions, but the first sentence assumes the action was done, while the second sentence questions the intent behind it, creating a contradiction.
