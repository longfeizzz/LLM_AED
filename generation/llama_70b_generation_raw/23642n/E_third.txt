1. The context implies a dichotomy between the two halves of the book, suggesting that if the second half is about true names, the first half might be about the opposite, which could be false names.
2. The use of "true name" in the context implies the existence of a contrast, which could be "false names", and the first half of the book might explore this contrast.
3. The book's structure, with the second half focused on true names, might indicate a sequential or comparative approach, starting with false names in the first half to set up the discussion of true names later.
