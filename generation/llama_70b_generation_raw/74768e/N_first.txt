1. The statement is undetermined because it does not specify the time frame in which she remained in control, and the context only mentions her being in control at 4 o'clock.
2. The context does not provide information about her state after 4 o'clock, so it is unclear if she remained in control for the entire duration of her anger.
3. The statement implies a prolonged period of remaining in control, but the context only provides a snapshot of her being in control at a single point in time (4 o'clock).
