1. The statement is a paraphrase or restatement of the context, so it doesn't provide new information to determine the relationship.
2. The context uses the word "FEEL" which could be interpreted literally, while the statement uses "sense" which could be more figurative, making the relationship unclear.
3. The context does not explicitly state what "him" refers to, so the statement's meaning and relationship to the context depend on unknown information.
