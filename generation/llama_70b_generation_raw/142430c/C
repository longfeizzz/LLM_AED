1. The assumption that discounted flying is more dangerous implies a contradiction to the statement that it's totally safe.
2. Discounted flying may involve cost-cutting measures that compromise safety, such as less experienced pilots or older aircraft.
3. The context suggests a trade-off between cost and safety, making it unlikely that discounted flying would be completely safe.
