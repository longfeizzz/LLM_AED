1. The statement only mentions the road, not the towns and villages themselves, so tourists could be present in the towns and villages even if the road is not heavily traveled by them.
2. The presence of tourists is not necessarily determined by the road they travel on, as they could be walking, biking, or using other modes of transportation to reach the towns and villages.
3. The statement that the towns and villages are "untouched by tourism" implies a lack of tourist infrastructure or significant tourist activity, but does not explicitly state that there are no tourists at all, allowing for the possibility of some tourists being present despite the lack of tourist-oriented development.
