1. The Chinese cosmological cycle is a repeating cycle, which means the same year can occur multiple times, making it difficult to pinpoint an exact year.
2. The length of the cycle (1,260 years) is not a precise measurement of time, but rather a cosmological concept.
3. Counting back a large number of years can introduce errors due to potential inconsistencies or gaps in historical records.
4. The Chinese calendar and the Japanese calendar may not have been perfectly synchronized, leading to potential discrepancies in the calculation.
