1. The context only mentions that the medieval French are among the groups that used the fortress, but does not specify that they were the original builders.
2. The presence of layers of masonry from different groups, including the Gallo-Romans, Visigoths, and Franks, suggests that the fortress has a longer and more complex history than a single construction event in 1173.
3. The context does not provide a specific construction date for the fortress, making it impossible to confirm the statement's claim of 1173 as the year of construction.
