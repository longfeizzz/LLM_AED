1. The statement about the Trump Tower is true because the context only mentions the Gaiety Theatre as being worth visiting for its ornate décor, implying other locations like the Trump Tower may not have the same quality of décor.
2. The Trump Tower's décor style is often described as modern and luxurious, which may not be considered ornate in the classical sense, making it a less suitable destination for those seeking ornate décor.
3. The context does not provide any information about the Trump Tower, so the statement is true by default as there is no evidence to suggest the Trump Tower has notable ornate décor.
