1. High humidity often accompanies warm temperatures, which can lead to sweaty conditions.
2. The body's ability to cool itself through sweating is impaired in humid environments, resulting in a perceived increase in temperature and sweatiness.
3. Warm air with high humidity holds more moisture, making the air feel warmer and more oppressive, contributing to sweaty temperatures.
