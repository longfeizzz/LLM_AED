1. The term "romance" can imply a range of emotional or social connections that may not necessarily involve a physical or sexual affair.
2. Having a romance does not inherently imply the existence of an affair, as romance can occur within the boundaries of a committed relationship or be a non-physical connection.
3. The context does not provide enough information to determine if the romance is extramarital or otherwise constitutes an affair.
