1. The statement is undetermined because it expresses a possibility ("might change") rather than a fact, and the context only describes current variation, not future change.
2. The context describes variation between agencies, not change over time, so it does not provide information about whether approaches to achieving missions change a lot.
3. The statement's phrase "a lot" is subjective and not clearly defined, making it difficult to determine its truth based on the context.
