1. The statement directly contradicts the information given in the context, which states the plane was flying lower than the rules for training missions allow.
2. The context implies that there are specific rules governing the altitude at which training missions can be conducted, and the plane in question was below that allowed altitude.
3. The NYT's front-page coverage explicitly mentions the plane was flying "far lower" than allowed, indicating a violation of training mission rules rather than compliance.
