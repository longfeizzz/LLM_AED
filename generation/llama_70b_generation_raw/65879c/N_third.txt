1. The context states it took four hundred years for Christian kings to subdue the Moors, indicating a prolonged period of conflict where the Moors were not quickly subdued by Christians, implying the opposite of the statement.
2. The statement claims the Moors subdued the Christian kings, but the context suggests the opposite outcome, with Christian kings and warlords ultimately succeeding in subduing the Moors.
3. The timeframe mentioned in the statement (a decade) contradicts the timeframe provided in the context (four hundred years), indicating the statement's claim about the duration and outcome of the conflict is inaccurate.
