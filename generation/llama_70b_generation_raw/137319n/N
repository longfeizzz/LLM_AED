1. The context does not explicitly state that the person being referred to is the one being spoken to.
2. The context uses the phrase "came to you" which implies the speaker is addressing someone directly, but it does not confirm the person being referred to is the same as the one in the statement.
3. The statement is in the form of a question, and the context provides a statement, not a question, making it unclear if the context is answering the question in the statement.
