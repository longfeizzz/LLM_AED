1. The context only mentions H-2A agricultural workers, not all types of agricultural work visas.
2. The requirement of maintaining a foreign residence does not necessarily imply it is a condition for all agricultural work visas, only for H-2A.
3. The statement's use of "permanent foreign residence" may not be equivalent to the context's "foreign residence which they have no intention of abandoning", as permanence could imply a different condition.
