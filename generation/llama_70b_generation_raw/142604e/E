1. Devolution of government programs to state and local government, private entities, and nonprofit organizations leads to a more dispersed and complex record-keeping system.
2. The increased number of third parties involved in government programs results in a higher likelihood of inconsistent or inadequate record-keeping practices.
3. GAO's access to records may be limited by the autonomy of third parties, which are not necessarily obligated to provide records to GAO.
4. The decentralization of government programs can lead to a lack of standardization in record-keeping, making it more challenging for GAO to obtain and consolidate the necessary records.
