1. The comparison "but worse" implies a difference in severity, contradicting the initial statement that they are the same.
2. The phrase "just like" suggests equivalence, which is then immediately contradicted by "but worse", indicating they are not the same.
3. If one is worse than the other, they cannot be considered the same, as "the same" implies equal severity or impact.
