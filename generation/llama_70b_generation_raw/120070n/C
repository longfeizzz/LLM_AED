1. The statement implies that the ten minute time limit is always in effect, but with occasional earlier endings, whereas the context suggests that the initial time limit may not be relevant when the five second warning is given.
2. The context mentions a five second time frame to say goodbye, which is significantly shorter than the implied earlier ending in the statement, and does not necessarily relate to the ten minute limit.
3. The statement does not convey the abruptness of the time limit change, as the context describes being told to end with only five seconds left, which may not be what someone would expect from being told to "end early".
