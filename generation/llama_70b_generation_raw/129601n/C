1. "Took forever" implies a much longer period than two years.
2. Two years can be considered a relatively short period in many contexts, contradicting the implication of "forever".
3. The phrase "took forever" is often used to express that something felt excessively long, but two years is a definite and relatively measurable time frame, which doesn't align with the subjective, endless feeling conveyed by "forever".
