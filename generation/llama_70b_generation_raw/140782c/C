1. The statement implies similarity in design or function, but the context suggests a difference in construction location between FGD and SCR systems.
2. FGD systems and SCR systems have distinct technological purposes, with FGD focusing on removing sulfur dioxide and SCR on reducing nitrogen oxides, making replication unlikely.
3. The context mentions FGD systems in relation to their physical placement, not their operational or design replication of SCR systems.
