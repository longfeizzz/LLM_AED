1. The context only mentions Sphinxes as guardian deities, but it does not specify what or whom they guarded, only that they provided monumental protection.
2. The description of the Sphinxes as "guardian deities" could imply they were protecting something more abstract, such as a temple, a city, or a concept, rather than directly guarding people.
3. The size and scale of the Sphinxes are described, suggesting their role might be more related to the protection of a physical space or territory rather than individual people.
