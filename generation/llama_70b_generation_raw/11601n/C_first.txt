1. The statement implies a greater than proportional relationship, which contradicts the given context that the AC usage should be roughly proportional to the total MWe.
2. The context assumes an average capacity factor of 85 percent, which suggests that the actual MWe output is a fraction of the total capacity, making it unlikely for AC usage to exceed total MWe.
