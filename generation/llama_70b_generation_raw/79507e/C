1. Alignment alone does not guarantee success, as external factors such as market conditions, competition, and economic trends can also impact an organization's success.
2. The statement does not account for the quality of the goals themselves, which could be poorly defined, unrealistic, or unethical, leading to unsuccessful outcomes despite alignment.
3. Alignment of activities, resources, and goals is necessary but not sufficient for success, as it does not consider the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization's core processes.
4. The organization's mission is not mentioned in the statement, which is a crucial aspect that should be supported by the alignment of activities, resources, and goals for the organization to be truly successful.
