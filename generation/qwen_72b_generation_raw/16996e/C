1. The statement only partially aligns with the context; it correctly identifies that U.S. consumers benefit but incorrectly generalizes that all factories in East Asia benefit, when the context specifically mentions parts made in East Asian factories benefiting U.S. multinationals, not necessarily all East Asian factories.
2. The context does not provide information about the benefits to East Asian factories beyond the parts they supply to U.S. multinationals, so it cannot be concluded that all factories in East Asia benefit from imports.
