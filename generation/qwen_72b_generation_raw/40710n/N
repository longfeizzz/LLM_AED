1. The context does not specify who "you" refers to, making it unclear if the advice is relevant to the person being addressed.
2. The context lacks information about the current skill level of the person, so it's unknown whether they need to keep practicing.
3. The context does not provide a goal or purpose for writing, which could influence whether continued practice is necessary.
4. The context does not indicate the frequency or duration of the writing activity, leaving it ambiguous whether "keep practicing" is appropriate advice.
