1. The context "was it bad" does not specify what "it" refers to, making it impossible to determine if the statement "Was it not good?" is true or false.
2. The context uses "bad" while the statement uses "not good," which may not be equivalent in meaning, leading to ambiguity.
3. The context is a question, and without knowing the answer to that question, it's impossible to determine the truth of the statement.
