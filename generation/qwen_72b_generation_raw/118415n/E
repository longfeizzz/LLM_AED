1. Nationalizing all postal delivery services and couriers into a single entity could reduce redundant operations and streamline delivery processes, aligning with the concept of a bottleneck function where a single firm operates more efficiently.
2. Consolidating delivery services under one entity might minimize the overhead and operational costs associated with multiple firms performing the same task, supporting the idea of achieving lower total costs.
3. A unified national delivery service could optimize route planning and resource allocation, further enhancing efficiency and reducing costs, which is consistent with Panzar's characterization of street delivery as a bottleneck function.
