1. FGD systems and SCR systems both involve significant construction efforts in power plants.
2. Both systems are designed to reduce emissions from power plants, leading to some functional similarities.
3. The proximity to the ground of FGD systems might influence their design to somewhat mirror the layout of other emission control systems like SCRs.
