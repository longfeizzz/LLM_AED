1. The impact of The Wild Bunch on societal views of violence is not universally positive; many still condemn violent acts regardless of their portrayal.
2. The film's influence may have been significant but not comprehensive enough to change the overall perception of violence to a positive one.
3. Other factors, such as media, education, and personal experiences, also shape perceptions of violence, potentially counteracting any positive portrayal by The Wild Bunch.
4. The film's aestheticization of violence might be appreciated artistically but does not necessarily translate to a positive moral or ethical view of violence in real life.
