1. The context indicates the train was "lying still on the tracks," suggesting it was not just stationary but possibly abandoned or broken down, making it unlikely to start moving again.
2. The phrase "far, far away" implies a distance that could mean the observer cannot accurately determine if the train started moving.
3. The description "back of the train" being visible suggests the front part might be out of view, and any movement could be from another part of the train not mentioned in the context.
