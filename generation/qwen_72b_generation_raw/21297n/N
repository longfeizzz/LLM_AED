1. The context specifies that the mother "walloped" him, which implies a more severe form of hitting, while the statement specifies hitting with a spoon, which may not be as severe.
2. The context does not specify the object used to wallop him, so it cannot be determined if it was a spoon.
3. The intensity and manner of crying could be the same regardless of the object used, but the statement makes a specific claim about the object being a spoon.
