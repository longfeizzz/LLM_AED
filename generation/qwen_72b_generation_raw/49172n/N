1. The context does not specify what "these" refers to, making it impossible to determine if "they" in the statement refers to the same thing.
2. The context uses "could," indicating potential but not certainty, while the statement uses "may," which also indicates potential but does not confirm the value.
3. The context mentions "valuable uses," which is about utility, whereas the statement refers to being "valuable," which could mean monetary or intrinsic worth, and this distinction is not clarified.
