1. The sensation of skin swelling and growing hot does not necessarily mean it is burning; it could be due to other causes such as an allergic reaction or contact with a chemical irritant.
2. The term "burning" can imply a more severe condition than just feeling hot or swollen, which may not be the case here.
3. Without additional information about the cause or the severity of the sensation, it cannot be determined if the skin is actually burning.
