1. The context only mentions the third row, but does not provide information about the total number of rows in Exhibit 17.
2. The presence of a third row does not necessarily imply that there are many rows; it could be one of only a few rows.
3. "Many" is a subjective term and what constitutes "many" rows is not defined in the context.
