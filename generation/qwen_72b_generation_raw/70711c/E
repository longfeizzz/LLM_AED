1. Starting plants in the cooler part of spring allows them to establish before the summer heat.
2. Plants started in spring have time to develop strong root systems, making them more resilient to summer temperatures.
3. The gradual increase in temperature from spring to summer is less stressful for young plants than starting them in summer's peak heat.
