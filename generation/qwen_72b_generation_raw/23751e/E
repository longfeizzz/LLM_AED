1. The presence of businesses among residential deliveries increases the average number of pieces per delivery because businesses typically receive more mail than individual residences.
2. Rural routes have fewer businesses, which could mean they receive fewer pieces per possible delivery compared to areas with a higher business-to-residence ratio.
3. The assumption about a lesser percentage of businesses on rural routes suggests that these routes might have a lower overall volume of mail, contributing to the difference in pieces per possible delivery.
