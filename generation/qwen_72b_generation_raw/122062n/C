1. The context only provides one example of a king founding an order that continues today, which is insufficient evidence to generalize that kings frequently did so.
2. The statement assumes a frequency ("frequently") that is not supported by the single instance provided in the context.
3. The context does not offer information about other orders founded by kings or their current existence, making it impossible to verify the frequency claim.
