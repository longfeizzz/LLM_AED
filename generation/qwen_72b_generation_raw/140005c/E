1. The statement is false because the definitive test duration is longer, which can affect the observed toxicity levels.
2. The statement is false because the sample used in the follow-up test might have been collected at a different time, potentially altering its toxicity.
3. The statement is false because differences in test conditions between the range-finding and follow-up tests can lead to variations in measured toxicity.
