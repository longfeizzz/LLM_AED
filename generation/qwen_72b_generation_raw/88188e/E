1. Warm air can hold more moisture, but in an arid environment, the air lacks sufficient moisture, leading to dry conditions that affect the surrounding land.
2. In warm, arid climates, evaporation rates are high, which can cause the air to become even drier and further dehydrate the land.
3. Warm temperatures can increase the rate of transpiration from plants, reducing soil moisture and contributing to the arid nature of the air and land.
