1. Marginal costs being very low suggest that the pricing is fair and covers only the additional cost of production, not including the fixed costs which new printers also have to bear.
2. New printers face similar low marginal costs, so the pricing does not specifically disadvantage them.
3. The low prices reflect the competitive market rate for preprints, which is not necessarily tied to the operational costs of individual printers.
4. Established printers might have economies of scale that allow them to offer lower prices, which is a standard market practice and not inherently unfair.
