1. The context "Per week?" suggests a weekly frequency, while "Every day" indicates a daily frequency, making it impossible to determine if the statement is true or false without additional information about the specific activity or event being discussed.
2. The context and statement refer to different time periods, creating ambiguity about the consistency of the activity or event across these periods.
3. Without knowing the subject of the frequency (what is happening per week or every day), it is undetermined if the statement aligns with the context.
