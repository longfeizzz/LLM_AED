1. Losing the entire unified surplus would have a more severe negative impact on GDP per capita growth than saving it, thus falling further short of the historical average.
2. The historical average of GDP per capita doubling every 35 years is independent of the current unified surplus, and losing the surplus would not change this long-term trend.
3. Other economic factors beyond the unified surplus contribute to GDP per capita growth, and these factors alone cannot compensate for the loss of the surplus.
