1. The context indicates that the experiments' results were consistent with random chance, which contradicts the statement that the experiments proved something was a much better predictor.
2. If the results aligned with random chance, there is no evidence to support the claim that any factor was a better predictor.
3. The conclusion drawn from the experiments suggests a lack of significant findings, which is incompatible with the statement's assertion of proving a better predictor.
