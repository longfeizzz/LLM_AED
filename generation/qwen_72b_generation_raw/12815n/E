1. Leagues occupy all lanes during specific times, preventing casual bowlers from finding available lanes.
2. The bowling alley schedules league games during peak hours, making it difficult to find open spots for non-league bowlers.
3. League bowling sessions are long, leaving little to no time for individual play outside of these sessions.
