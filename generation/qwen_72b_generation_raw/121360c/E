1. The hooked tip design, similar to that of slaughter knives, indicates a specific function rather than general durability.
2. Slaughter knives are designed for precise cuts rather than brute force, suggesting the tips might be thin and easily damaged.
3. The material used for these tips could be lightweight or less robust, making them prone to breaking under pressure.
4. The specific use case (slaughter) may not require the tip to withstand significant force, implying fragility.
5. The shape and purpose of the tip suggest it is optimized for slicing rather than puncturing or scratching hard surfaces.
