1. The context and statement involve different terms that may not always align ("romance" vs. "have an affair").
2. The context does not specify the nature or extent of the romantic involvement, leaving ambiguity about whether it constitutes an affair.
3. The context is a question, which does not provide enough information to determine if the statement is true or false.
