1. The statement could be true if the amount of AC required for mercury control per unit of MWe is disproportionately high, leading to a greater overall AC usage compared to the total MWe.
2. The statement might hold if there are additional coal-fired facilities not included in the total MWe calculation but still using AC for mercury control.
3. It is possible that the capacity factor assumption of 85 percent underestimates the actual operational time of the coal-fired facilities, resulting in higher AC usage.
4. The statement could be accurate if the tables (4-4 and 4-5) contain data that overestimate the efficiency of AC usage, leading to a higher reported AC usage relative to the total MWe.
