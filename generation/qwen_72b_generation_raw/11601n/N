1. The statement compares AC usage for mercury control to the total MWe of coal-fired facilities, but the context suggests a proportional relationship, not a direct comparison of magnitude.
2. The context assumes an average capacity factor of 85 percent, which means the actual operational output may differ from the installed capacity, affecting the proportionality.
3. Other assumptions in Tables 4-4 and 4-5 may influence the relationship between AC usage and MWe, making it unclear if the statement holds true.
4. The statement does not account for variations in the efficiency of AC usage across different power plants, which could affect the overall proportionality.
