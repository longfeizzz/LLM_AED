1. The statement confuses units; AC usage measures quantity of activated carbon while MWe measures electrical generating capacity.
2. AC usage for mercury control is a function of the amount of mercury emissions to be controlled, not directly the MWe capacity.
3. The relationship described in the context suggests proportionality between AC usage and MWe equipped with the technology, not a direct comparison of values.
4. An 85 percent capacity factor implies that plants do not operate at full capacity all the time, reducing the actual AC usage compared to maximum MWe potential.
