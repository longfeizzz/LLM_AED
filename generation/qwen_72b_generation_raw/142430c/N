1. The context suggests a correlation between cheaper flights and increased safety risks, which contradicts the statement's claim of total safety.
2. The statement uses absolute language ("totally safe") which cannot be verified based on the context provided.
3. The context implies that cost reductions might lead to compromises in safety measures, making it impossible to determine the absolute safety of discounted flights.
