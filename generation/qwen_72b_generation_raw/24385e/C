1. The context specifies "farmworkers conducted by the U.S.," which implies a broader action such as a survey or study, not necessarily sampling.
2. The statement "Some farm laborers were sampled" suggests a specific subset was selected for analysis, which is not explicitly supported by the context.
3. The context does not specify the method of data collection, so it cannot be concluded that sampling was part of the process.
