1. The context specifies that the village is named Sainte-Marie, which suggests it is named after a saint, not the explorer.
2. The explorer's name is not mentioned, so there is no information indicating the village was named after him.
3. The context highlights natural features (waterfalls and river) as the reason for naming, not the explorer's personal contribution.
