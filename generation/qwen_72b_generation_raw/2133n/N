1. The context mentions a tomb guardian, not a tomb garden, so there is no information about what a tomb garden can do.
2. The context indicates that the catacomb is small and circular, suggesting a limited exploration area, which contradicts the idea of a thorough tour.
3. The context states that what little can be seen is hardly worth the effort, implying that a thorough tour is unlikely to be possible or worthwhile.
