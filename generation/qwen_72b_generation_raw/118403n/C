1. Planting when it is warmer allows seeds to germinate more quickly due to higher soil temperatures.
2. Warmer conditions can reduce stress on young plants as they establish roots.
3. Colder temperatures may inhibit seed germination and slow down plant growth.
4. Plants may be more susceptible to frost damage if planted in cold conditions.
