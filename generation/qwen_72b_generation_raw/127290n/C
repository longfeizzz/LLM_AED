1. Case studies involve in-depth analysis of specific instances, while data collection is about gathering information, which may require different logical approaches.
2. The logic in case studies often emphasizes interpretative and qualitative reasoning, whereas data collection focuses on systematic and quantitative methods.
3. Case studies may require a more flexible and iterative logic to adapt to unique aspects of each case, unlike the standardized logic typically used in data collection.
