1. There is no indication of a "tomb garden" in the context, only a "tomb guardian", suggesting a potential misinterpretation or confusion between the two terms.
2. The context explicitly states that the catacomb is "small" and "circular", implying that it may not be complex or extensive enough to require or support a thorough tour.
3. The tomb guardian only provides a candle, which may not be sufficient to illuminate the entire catacomb, and the context notes that "it is hardly worth the effort" to explore, implying that a thorough tour may not be feasible or worthwhile.
