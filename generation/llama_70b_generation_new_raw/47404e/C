1. The term "romance" implies a deep emotional connection or love, which is different from the implication of a casual or secretive relationship often associated with the term "affair".
2. Having a romance does not necessarily involve the element of secrecy or dishonesty that is often a part of having an affair.
3. Romance can occur within the bounds of a committed relationship, whereas an affair typically involves someone who is already in a committed relationship engaging in a relationship with someone else outside of that commitment.
