1. The context describes a hypothetical situation where a decline in consumer confidence leads to an increased willingness to accumulate coupons, but it does not provide information about the current policies of US stores regarding coupon collecting.
2. The statement about coupon collecting being no longer allowed in most US stores is unrelated to the context, which focuses on consumer behavior and confidence rather than store policies.
3. There is no logical connection between the context's discussion of consumer confidence and coupon accumulation, and the statement about the prohibition of coupon collecting in US stores.
