1. The context mentions a woman and a child being left, which suggests that the men were not the only ones taken, or it implies that the woman and child were spared, contradicting the idea of only men being taken as slaves.
2. The presence of a woman and a child being left behind indicates that the action was not exclusively targeted at men, as the statement about taking only men as slaves would imply.
3. The context does not explicitly state that men were taken as slaves, only that a woman and a child (or the cat, the sheep) were left, which does not support the claim about the men being taken.
