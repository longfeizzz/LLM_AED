1. The tips were hooked and hammered in a way that is typically used for knives intended to cut through tough materials, suggesting they were designed for strength and durability, not fragility.
2. The comparison to knives used for slaughter implies that the tips were designed for heavy use and making deep cuts, which is inconsistent with being fragile.
3. A hook-like shape can provide additional structural support and make the tip more resistant to breaking or chipping, contradicting the idea that they were fragile.
