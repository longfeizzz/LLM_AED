1. The tips being hooked towards the edge would make them prone to breaking or chipping if used for scratching, thus rendering them fragile.
2. The comparison to knives used for slaughter implies the tips were designed for a specific task, possibly not involving scratching, which could explain their inability to leave a scratch.
3. The hooked tips might have been too thin or curved to effectively apply the necessary pressure to leave a scratch, making them ineffective for that purpose.
