1. The statement does not account for variations in capacity factor among coal-fired facilities, which could affect the actual mercury control AC usage.
2. Other assumptions in Tables 4-4 and 4-5 may not hold true, leading to discrepancies between predicted and actual AC usage.
3. The average capacity factor of 85 percent may not accurately represent the capacity factor of all coal-fired facilities equipped with mercury control technology.
4. The statement implies a direct comparison between AC usage and MWe, without considering potential differences in efficiency or operation of mercury control systems.
5. The context only provides a rough proportionality, allowing for deviations between actual AC usage and total MWe from coal facilities.
