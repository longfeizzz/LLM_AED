1. The context only mentions the logic of analysis, not the logic for the case studies as a whole, which may encompass more than just analysis.
2. Data collection is a distinct phase from analysis, and the logic governing one phase may not necessarily apply to the other.
3. The context does not explicitly state that the logic of analysis is equivalent to the overall logic for case studies, which could include design, data collection, and other aspects.
