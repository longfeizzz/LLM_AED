1. The statement implies that the logic for case studies is identical to the logic used in data collection, which may not be the case as the logic of analysis in case studies specifically refers to the method of examining and interpreting the data after it has been collected.
2. Data collection and case study analysis are distinct phases of research, with data collection focusing on gathering information and case study analysis focusing on interpreting and drawing conclusions from that information, suggesting their logics serve different purposes.
3. The logic of analysis in case studies involves making inferences, identifying patterns, and drawing conclusions from the collected data, which is a different process than the logic used to determine what data to collect or how to collect it.
