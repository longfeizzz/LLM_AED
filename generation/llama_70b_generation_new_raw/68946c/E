1. The statement is not supported because the context only mentions that the medieval French are among those who used the fortress, not that they were the sole or original builders.
2. The context implies multiple layers of construction by different groups, suggesting that the fortress underwent modifications or expansions over time, rather than being built by a single entity in a specific year.
3. The absence of a specific construction date in the context, particularly for the medieval French, contradicts the assertion that the fortress was built by them in 1173.
