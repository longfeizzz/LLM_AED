1. The statement mentions tipping "in addition to the tax on the menus", but the context clarifies that most menu prices already include taxes, making the premise of the statement misleading.
2. The context states that menu prices include a service charge, which might be considered as already covering the tip, potentially reducing the need for additional tipping.
3. The condition for leaving a tip is "if you were served satisfactorily", implying that not all customers will receive satisfactory service, and thus not all will tip.
