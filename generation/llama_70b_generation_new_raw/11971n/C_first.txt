1. The study found no evidence of increased cancer or toxic effects, but it does not mention that the animals lived as long as the others.
2. The statement implies that the animals' lifespan was unaffected, but the context only discusses the absence of increased cancer or toxic effects, not lifespan.
3. The context specifies that the study was on dogs and other animals, and it is unclear if "the rest of them" refers to animals not fed irradiated chicken or animals in general, making the comparison ambiguous.
