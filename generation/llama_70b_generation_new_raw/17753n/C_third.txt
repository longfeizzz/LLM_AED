1. The statement only mentions the end of the street, not the entire length, so it's unclear if the luxury is consistent throughout.
2. The presence of luxurious hotels and a cultural centre does not necessarily imply that the street itself is luxurious, as these could be isolated establishments.
3. The description focuses on the area around Taksim Square, not the street's overall character or the quality of the street itself.
