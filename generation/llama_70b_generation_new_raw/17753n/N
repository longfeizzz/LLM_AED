1. The statement only mentions the street ending at Taksim Square, which has luxurious hotels, but does not provide information about the street itself.
2. The presence of luxurious five-star hotels and the Ataturk Cultural Centre is at the end of the street, not necessarily along its entire length.
3. The description of the area at the end of the street does not necessarily imply that the street itself is luxurious, as the characteristics of the surrounding area do not define the street's nature.
