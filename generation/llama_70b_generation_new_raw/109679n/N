1. The statement uses the phrase "houses a wonderful square court" which implies a positive evaluation of the court, but the context only provides a neutral description of the court's architecture.
2. The context does not provide enough information to determine if the square court is "wonderful" as the statement claims, it only describes its structure.
3. The statement's emphasis on the court being "wonderful" introduces a subjective judgment that is not present in the context.
