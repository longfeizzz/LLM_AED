1. The statement "Took forever" is an idiomatic expression meaning a long and indefinite period of time, which does not necessarily correspond to a specific duration like two years.
2. "Forever" implies a duration without end, whereas two years is a finite and bounded period of time.
3. The context suggests a subjective experience of time, where "forever" describes a perceived duration that felt excessively long, rather than an objective measurement of time like two years.
