1. The statement incorrectly includes "factories in East Asia" as beneficiaries, when in fact it is U.S. multinationals that use parts made in those factories that benefit, not the factories themselves.
2. The statement fails to specify that the benefit is in the short term, implying a potentially permanent or long-term benefit.
