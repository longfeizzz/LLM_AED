2. The context specifies that U.S. multinationals benefit because they use parts made in East Asian factories, implying an indirect benefit, whereas the statement suggests a direct benefit to the factories.
3. The context does not explicitly state that the factories in East Asia benefit from the imports, only that they produce parts used by U.S. multinationals.
