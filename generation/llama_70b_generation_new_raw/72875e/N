1. The statement implies a causal relationship between the policy's success and the ability to make a contribution, but the context only mentions the policy succeeding and the contribution being made, without explicitly stating that one caused the other.
2. The context suggests that the contribution was already made, and the speaker is expressing gratitude for the opportunity, whereas the statement implies that the success of the policy enabled the contribution to be made, which may not be the case.
3. The statement's use of "because" implies a direct causal link, but the context leaves open the possibility that the contribution was a separate event that happened to occur while the policy was in effect, rather than being a direct result of the policy's success.
