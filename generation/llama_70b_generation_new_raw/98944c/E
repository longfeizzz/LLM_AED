1. The context explicitly mentions "evaluation questions", implying that the focus is on assessing or evaluating something, and thus only statements related to this evaluation are present.
2. The term "evaluation" itself suggests a process of assessing or judging, which typically involves statements that provide information about the evaluation, rather than other types of information.
3. The phrase "only statements of the evaluation" directly indicates that no other types of information or statements are available, reinforcing the idea that the context is limited to evaluation-related statements.
