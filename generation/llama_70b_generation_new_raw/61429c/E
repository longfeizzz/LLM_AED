1. The statement is not supported by the context, as it mentions "ladies" instead of "small lepers" and does not imply that the workplace is exclusive to them.
2. The context does not specify the health or physical condition of the ladies, so it cannot be inferred that they are lepers.
3. The context describes the workers as having a specific skill ("expertly chopping"), which contradicts the implication that they are only able to work there due to limited opportunities.
