1. The statement is too general and does not specify what was waiting, which could be the page-boy, but also potentially something or someone else.
2. The context only mentions the page-boy waiting outside "her own door", but it does not exclude the possibility of something else also waiting.
3. The statement's use of "something" is ambiguous and could refer to an object, an animal, or another person, not necessarily the page-boy.
