1. The context only mentions that "these alone" could have valuable uses, but it does not specify what "they" refers to, making it unclear if "they" is equivalent to "these alone".
2. The statement "They may be valuable" implies a possibility, but the context only provides a possibility for "these alone", without confirming that "they" is the same entity.
3. The word "alone" in the context suggests that the valuable uses are specific to "these" being isolated or separate, which may not apply to "they" if "they" includes additional elements.
