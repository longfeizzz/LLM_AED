1. The context directly contradicts the statement, as it is stated that Al is being spoken to about not being interested in tactics, implying the speaker thinks Al is interested, but the speaker's own interest is what is being expressed.
2. The statement refers to Al's interest, but the context only provides information about the speaker's interest in tactics.
3. There is ambiguity regarding who "I" refers to and their relationship with Al, making it unclear if the speaker's disinterest in tactics reflects Al's interests.
