1. The context mentions blockbusters in relation to books, not films, indicating a focus on the book publishing industry rather than the film industry.
2. There is no mention of big publishers wanting to produce high budget films, the concern is about the impact on book production.
3. The statement implies a trade-off between producing films and books, which is not suggested in the context, where the alleged influence is on the type of books published, not on shifting resources to film production.
