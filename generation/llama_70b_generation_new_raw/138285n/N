1. The context only mentions two specific instances of the speaker crying, which may not be sufficient to generalize that all animal killings make them want to cry.
2. The speaker's emotional response might be dependent on the narrative or circumstances surrounding the animal killings, rather than the act itself.
3. The context does not provide information about the speaker's reaction to other animal killings, which could be different from the two mentioned instances.
