1. Warm air is often associated with arid conditions, which can lead to dry air permeating the surrounding land.
2. The warmth of the air can increase evaporation, contributing to the aridification of the air and its ability to permeate the land.
3. Warm air has a higher capacity to hold moisture, but in this context, its warmth also indicates a lack of moisture, allowing the arid air to spread and permeate the surrounding area.
