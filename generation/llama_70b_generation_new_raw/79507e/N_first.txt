1. The statement does not define what is meant by "successful", which could encompass various aspects such as financial performance, social impact, or customer satisfaction.
2. Alignment of activities, resources, and goals is a necessary but not sufficient condition for success, as other factors like market conditions, competition, or external events can influence outcomes.
3. The context only mentions alignment supporting the mission and achieving goals, but does not explicitly state that this alignment guarantees success.
4. Success can depend on the effectiveness of the alignment, not just its presence, and the statement does not account for the quality of the alignment.
5. The statement lacks a clear timeframe for measuring success, as alignment at one point does not ensure long-term success or adaptability to changing circumstances.
