1. The context states that well-designed studies typically report narrower uncertainty bounds than studies of lesser quality, indicating variability in uncertainty among studies.
2. The phrase "narrower uncertainty bounds" implies that the amount of uncertainty can differ between studies, contradicting the idea that all studies have the same amount of uncertainty.
3. The comparison between well-designed studies and those of "lesser quality" suggests that study quality influences the level of uncertainty, leading to differences in uncertainty among studies.
