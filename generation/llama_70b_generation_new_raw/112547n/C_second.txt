1. Having credibility does not guarantee that everyone will believe what a person says, as individual opinions and biases can still influence belief.
2. The presence of credibility only increases the likelihood of being believed, but does not ensure universal acceptance of one's statements.
3. Other factors, such as personal experiences, evidence, and prior knowledge, can also affect whether someone believes a particular statement, regardless of the speaker's credibility.
