1. Starting in the spring allows for growth before the peak summer heat, potentially making the plants more resilient to high temperatures.
2. The initial cooler spring weather provides a more favorable condition for establishment, which can help the plants cope with the subsequent summer heat.
3. An earlier start in the spring can lead to an earlier maturity, potentially allowing the plants to complete their growth cycle before the hottest part of the summer.
