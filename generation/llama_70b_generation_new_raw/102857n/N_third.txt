1. The context only mentions "education and training programs" in general, not specifically "college programs", so it's unclear if the statement applies to college programs.
2. The context states that expenses are reported as investments in human capital, but it does not explicitly state that the net cost is calculated to increase productivity, only that the programs are intended to do so.
3. The relationship between net cost calculation and increasing productivity is not directly addressed in the context, it only mentions that the programs are intended to increase national economic productive capacity.
