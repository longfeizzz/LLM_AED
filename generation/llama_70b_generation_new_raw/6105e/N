1. The context does not explicitly state that Jim Nicholson's response was the party's standard answer, only that he invoked the "party-line inclusive party".
2. The term "party-line inclusive party" is ambiguous and does not necessarily imply a standard answer on abortion.
3. There is no information provided about what the party's standard answer on abortion actually is, making it impossible to determine if Jim Nicholson's response matched it.
