1. The comparison of a wife and mother suggests Bunt's lack of distinction between the two roles may stem from not having a traditional family experience.
2. Bunt's inability to differentiate between a wife and a mother could be due to the absence of a maternal figure in his upbringing, leading to a blurred understanding of their roles.
3. The orphanage environment, devoid of a maternal influence, may have contributed to Bunt's perception that wives and mothers are interchangeable, as he lacked a personal reference point for a mother's role.
