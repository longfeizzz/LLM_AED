1. The context does not explicitly mention "glamour" as the basis for comparison, only that "the living is not equal to the Ritz".
2. The context does not provide enough information to determine if "the living" being "not equal" to the Ritz implies it is "nothing" in comparison.
3. The emotional expression in the context ("with a sigh") does not necessarily equate to saying something "sadly", as sighing can express various emotions beyond sadness.
