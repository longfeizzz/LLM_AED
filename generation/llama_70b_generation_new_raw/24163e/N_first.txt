1. The context only mentions that "we have done that spectacularly", which implies the action or method was spectacular, but does not necessarily imply the results were spectacular.
2. The statement makes a claim about the results being the only way to describe the impact, while the context does not provide enough information to confirm that no other description could fit.
3. The context does not explicitly state that the spectacular nature of the action led to spectacular results, leaving open the possibility that the results were not spectacular despite the method being so.
