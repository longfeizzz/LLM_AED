1. The statement lacks specificity regarding the scale of production, as "large scaled" is subjective and not quantitatively defined.
2. The context mentions "large scale production" in relation to it being a phenomenon worth seeing, which may imply the scale of production is notable for its observability rather than its actual size.
3. The term "elaborate" is not supported by the context, which only discusses the scale of production, not its complexity or intricacy.
