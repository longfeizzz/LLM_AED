1. The context mentions activities expected to have a regulatory action within the next 12 months, but it does not imply that actions are implemented because they are shorter than 12 months.
2. The statement implies a causal relationship between the duration of an action and its implementation, which is not supported by the context.
3. The context actually suggests that activities with a longer time frame than 12 months may also be included, which contradicts the idea that actions are implemented for being shorter than 12 months.
