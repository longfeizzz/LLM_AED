1. The context explicitly mentions the outbreak of the Korean War, implying that Korea was indeed at war, but it does not specify Japan's involvement in the current conflict, only its past and economic relationship.
2. The statement "it had battled so furiously just a few years earlier" refers to Japan's past conflict, suggesting a previous war between Japan and another entity, possibly implying Korea or its allies, but the current situation described is Japan supplying an army, not actively engaging in combat.
3. The text does not provide a clear indication of Japan's current military involvement in the Korean War, only its role as a supplier, which does not necessarily mean it is at war with Korea at the time of the economic jump-start.
