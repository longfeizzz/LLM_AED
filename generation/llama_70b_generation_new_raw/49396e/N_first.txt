1. The statement only mentions the road and the towns and villages, but it does not provide information about the presence or absence of tourists on the road itself, only that the towns and villages are untouched by tourism.
2. The absence of tourism in the towns and villages does not necessarily imply that there are no tourists on the road, as tourists could be passing through without visiting or interacting with the local communities.
3. The road may still be used by tourists traveling to other destinations, even if the towns and villages themselves are not tourist attractions.
