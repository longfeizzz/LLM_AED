1. The context states the village was named by the explorer, implying the village is named after or by the explorer, not necessarily that it is named after a settler.
2. There is no information provided about the explorer settling in the village, only that he landed and named it.
3. The context does not distinguish between the explorer being a settler or just a visitor, making it unclear if the statement about not being named after a settler is true or false based on the explorer's role.
