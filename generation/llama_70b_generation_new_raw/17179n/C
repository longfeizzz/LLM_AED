1. "DON'T THINK" and "do not use your crazy mind" have different meanings, as "DON'T THINK" is a general instruction to stop thinking, while "do not use your crazy mind" specifically implies not using a potentially creative or unconventional aspect of one's mind.
2. The original context does not mention the mind being "crazy", which is an added descriptor in the statement that changes its tone and implication.
