1. The context does not mention the reason for the persistence, so it cannot be determined that it persisted out of protest.
2. The phrase "nevertheless it persisted" implies a contrast to the rejection, but does not provide information about the motivation or cause of the persistence.
3. The context only establishes a temporal relationship between the rejection and the persistence, without providing insight into the underlying reasons or mechanisms.
