1. The context only provides a negative evaluation ("was it bad") without explicitly confirming or denying the statement, which is also a negative evaluation ("Was it not good").
2. The context does not provide enough information to determine the relationship between "bad" and "not good", as they could be related but not exactly equivalent in this specific situation.
3. The statement is a question and the context is also a question, so there is no definitive answer to determine the relationship between them.
