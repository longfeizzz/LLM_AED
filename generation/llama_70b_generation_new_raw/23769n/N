1. The context does not provide information about the visitation frequency of Kom Ombo, so it cannot be determined if it is rarely visited.
2. The term "strange" is not equivalent to "unusual", as they may have different connotations or implications.
3. The context only mentions the temple being dedicated to two gods, but does not imply that this is the only unusual aspect of the temple, so the statement's characterization of the temple as strange may not be entirely accurate.
