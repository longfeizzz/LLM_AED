1. The statement is a question, and the context does not provide a definitive answer, only a lack of information.
2. The context mentions the absence of "inscriptions or or dates or anything else", which could imply the absence of dates, but does not directly confirm the statement.
3. The context is informal and hesitant, with filler words ("uh", "or"), which may indicate uncertainty or incompleteness of information.
