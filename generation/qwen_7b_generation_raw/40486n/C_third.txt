1. The Women's Haven already having a full-time attorney does not necessarily imply it is a useful resource; other factors such as quality of services, effectiveness, and community feedback determine usefulness.
2. The statement does not specify how the Haven's services are utilized or valued by the community, making it impossible to conclude its usefulness based solely on having a full-time attorney.
3. Useful resources typically offer comprehensive support, yet the context only mentions shelter and outreach, potentially missing other crucial needs of domestic-violence victims.
