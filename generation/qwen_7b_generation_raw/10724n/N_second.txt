1. The statement does not specify when the prices of these designs were compared, making it unclear if the pricing change occurred after the designs became available to all.
2. The context does not provide information about the pricing of designs reserved for royalty, so we cannot infer their cost relative to non-royal designs.
3. The availability of designs to the general public does not necessarily correlate with price changes; other factors could influence costs.
4. Without specific price data from both the royal and non-royal periods, it's impossible to determine if the designs once reserved for royalty were indeed more expensive.
