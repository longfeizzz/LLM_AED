1. Large areas require more water and nutrients, increasing costs.
2. Summer heat intensifies water evaporation, raising irrigation expenses.
3. Fertilizer effectiveness diminishes with extreme temperatures, necessitating higher application rates.
4. Higher grass density on larger areas demands greater maintenance inputs.
5. Larger grounds have more soil surface area exposed to sun, accelerating water loss.
