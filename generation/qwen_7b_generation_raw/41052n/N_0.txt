1. The notice was a proposed rulemaking, not a finalized rule, so HCFA's intentions regarding information dissemination are unclear.
2. The publication date does not provide information on HCFA's efforts to inform the public beyond this single action.
3. There is no evidence that HCFA took additional steps to ensure widespread awareness of the proposed rules beyond this notice.
