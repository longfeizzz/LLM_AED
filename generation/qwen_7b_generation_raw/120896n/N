1. The scribbled words were ambiguous and could have multiple interpretations, making it unclear if they indicated a will.
2. The context does not specify what the scribbled words said, so their relevance to discovering a will cannot be determined.
3. There might have been other contextual clues not mentioned that led to the conclusion of a will, making the scribbled words alone insufficient evidence.
4. The speaker's tone or additional information provided by Poirot could suggest a will without being explicitly stated in the scribbled words.
