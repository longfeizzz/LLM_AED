1. Insurance companies typically focus on verifying the nature and extent of injuries or conditions rather than the sobriety of patients at the time of incidents.
2. Ensuring patient follow-up is more about completeness of claims and accuracy of information than directly reducing medical payments through sobriety checks.
3. Claim denials due to intoxication are rare as policies generally cover accidents regardless of the patient's state of intoxication.
4. Follow-ups aim to gather comprehensive patient history and context, not specifically to check sobriety status.
