1. The phrase "spectacularly" suggests a manner or style rather than an outcome, which does not align with describing the results as "spectacular."
2. Using "the only way" implies exclusivity, suggesting no alternative descriptions were possible, but "spectacularly" does not preclude other positive outcomes or descriptions.
3. "Spectacularly" as an adverb modifies how something was done, not necessarily the extent or nature of the results themselves.
