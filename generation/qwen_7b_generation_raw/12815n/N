1. The speaker misunderstands "always" to mean they cannot bowl due to leagues, when in fact it means leagues are consistently available.
2. The speaker conflates availability with accessibility, assuming leagues prevent them from bowling when they actually just organize the schedule.
3. The speaker misinterprets the context of "league bowling" as a barrier to individual bowling rather than a structured group activity.
