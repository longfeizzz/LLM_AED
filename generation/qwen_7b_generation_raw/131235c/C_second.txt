1. The context does not mention anything about losing the unified surplus affecting GDP per capita.
2. The statement and context refer to opposite outcomes (saving vs. losing) which do not necessarily correlate.
3. The context implies that saving the surplus still results in falling short of the U.S. historical average; thus, losing it might or might not change this outcome, but the statement does not provide information to support this.
