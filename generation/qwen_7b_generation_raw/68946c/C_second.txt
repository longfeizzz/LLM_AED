1. The statement implies exclusive construction by the medieval French, which contradicts the context mentioning other groups' contributions.
2. The context indicates multiple layers of masonry from various periods, suggesting a long history of construction and modification rather than a single-building event.
3. The precise year 1173 is not mentioned or implied in the context, making the statement's specific timing inaccurate.
4. The involvement of Gallo-Romans, Visigoths, and Franks before the medieval French contradicts the statement's claim of sole medieval French construction.
