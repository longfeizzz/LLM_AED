1. Zen temples and their rock gardens are traditionally places for contemplation and meditation, not for large gatherings or celebrations.
2. The presence of recorded announcements and loud music contradicts the serene atmosphere expected in such spaces.
3. Ringing souvenir shops and garish displays are inconsistent with the solemn and peaceful environment of a Zen temple.
4. Rock gardens are designed for individual reflection rather than communal activities.
