1. FGD systems and SCR systems serve different purposes and have distinct designs.
2. FGD systems typically use liquid absorbents while SCR systems use catalysts and reductants.
3. The placement of FGD systems near the ground is not related to replicating SCR systems' functionality.
4. SCR systems are usually installed higher up in the flue gas path for optimal ammonia distribution.
