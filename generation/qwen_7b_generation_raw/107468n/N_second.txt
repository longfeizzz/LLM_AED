1. The context does not specify what "it" is, and different terrains or situations might require other methods of passage that are more efficient or suitable than walking.
2. "It" could refer to a situation or concept rather than a physical obstacle, making walking impractical or irrelevant.
3. The context only states that walking is necessary, not that it is the best method. Other factors like time constraints, health conditions, or personal preferences may make alternatives better.
