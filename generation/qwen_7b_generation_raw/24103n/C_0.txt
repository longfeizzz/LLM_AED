1. Using full conventional power does not inherently limit maximizing potential; it depends on how the power is utilized.
2. The statement does not specify what potential is being referred to, making it unclear what exactly is being maximized or not.
3. Modern warfare and strategy involve a mix of conventional and unconventional tactics; limiting to full conventional power could be strategic rather than indicative of inability.
4. The U.S. military has advanced technology and resources that can still achieve maximum potential even with conventional power use.
5. The statement lacks context about specific scenarios or goals, making it difficult to assess the validity of the claim.
