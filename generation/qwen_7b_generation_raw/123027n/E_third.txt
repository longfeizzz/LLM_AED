1. High humidity increases air temperature and makes sweat less effective at cooling the body, leading to warm, sweaty conditions.
2. Warm temperatures contribute to high humidity, creating an environment where sweat cannot evaporate easily, resulting in a feeling of warmth and increased sweating.
3. The combination of warm air and high moisture content in the air causes the body to sweat more to attempt cooling, producing warm, sweaty temperatures.
