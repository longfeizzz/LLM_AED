True,113668n,E,3,"By imposing restrictions and allowing for proportional reductions, Section 414 directly contributes to achieving balanced allowance allocations among units."
True,113668n,E,4,"The requirement for pro rata reductions in Section 414 prevents any unit from disproportionately benefiting or suffering, thus maintaining balance."

True,11601n,E,4,Variations in coal quality or other operational factors among coal-fired plants might lead to differences in AC usage that do not reflect MWe alone.
True,11601n,N,1,"The context suggests a proportional relationship based on MWe, while the statement claims a higher AC usage, which contradicts this proportionality."
True,11601n,N,2,"The context specifies an average capacity factor of 85%, which may not apply to all coal-fired facilities, potentially affecting the statement's validity."

True,120070n,E,3,"This suggests that while the formal limit is ten minutes, practical constraints may reduce the speaking time to just a few seconds in some cases."
True,120070n,N,1,"The statement conflates two different time limits: a ten-minute overall limit and a five-second ""good-bye"" command."
True,120070n,N,2,"The context suggests variability in when someone might be told to stop speaking, which is not explicitly stated in the statement."
True,120070n,C,1,The statement incorrectly claims a ten-minute limit when the context specifies a ten-second limit for saying goodbye.

True,124839c,E,2,"The context introduces a contrasting idea about freedom of association being an ""even bigger stretch,"" suggesting that the notion of contributions being indicative of strong support might be considered an overreach or exaggeration."
True,124839c,E,3,"Justice Thomas's perspective on freedom of association is presented as something he would dismiss, implying skepticism towards claims of significant support based solely on financial contributions.

True,126486n,N,2,"Without direct evidence linking the setup to increased lobbying, it remains possible that other factors unrelated to the setup have caused an increase in political lobbying."
True,126486n,N,3,The context describes the setup's flavor but does not explicitly state or imply causation between the setup and increased lobbying activities.
True,126486n,N,4,Increased political lobbying could be a consequence of broader economic or social trends rather than specifically due to the described setup.
True,126486n,C,1,"The context suggests the setup favors political lobbying over good business practices, implying increased lobbying is a consequence, not the cause."
True,126486n,C,2,"The term ""anti-competitive"" indicates the setup hinders competition, which would likely reduce, not increase, political lobbying efforts aimed at maintaining market balance."

True,127290n,N,1,"The context only mentions the logic of analysis being the same, not data collection."
True,127290n,N,2,Data collection and analysis might use different logics even if the overall study logic remains consistent.
True,127290n,N,3,The statement assumes a direct correlation between analysis logic and data collection logic that is not supported by the given context.
True,127290n,C,1,"Case studies often involve qualitative methods, while data collection may include quantitative methods, making their logics distinct."
True,127290n,C,2,"Case studies focus on deep, detailed examination of specific instances, whereas data collection is broader and more general."
True,127290n,C,3,"The logic in case studies typically involves interpretive analysis, while data collection primarily aims at systematic observation and measurement."

True,127809n,C,3,The speaker could have partial clarity on certain details.
True,12815n,E,1,The speaker consistently finds only league games available when attempting to bowl.
True,12815n,N,1,"The speaker misunderstands ""always"" to mean they cannot bowl due to leagues, when in fact it means leagues are consistently available."

True,13760n,N,3,"The statement could imply that overestimation would lead to overly conservative inflation adjustments, which might result in reduced government spending or higher taxes, thus creating negative economic impacts."
True,13760n,N,4,"The term ""horrific consequences"" might be based on assumptions about the CPI's role in entitlement programs, where underestimating inflation could lead to larger benefits, whereas overestimation could reduce them, affecting millions of recipients negatively."
True,13760n,C,1,Overestimating the CPI's error does not necessarily lead to horrific consequences; underestimating it could result in significant economic distortions.
True,13760n,C,2,"The statement overlooks that overestimation might prompt corrective measures, potentially mitigating any negative impacts."

True,138530e,E,2,"The object was designed to produce both tactile and auditory feedback simultaneously, resulting in a quiet hum when touched."
True,138530e,E,3,"The surface of the object had small, rapid movements that created a vibration, which, at a certain intensity, produced a faint humming sound."
True,138530e,E,4,"The material of the object resonated when vibrated, amplifying the sound to a quiet hum detectable by the user's hand."
True,138530e,E,5,"The movement inside the object caused air displacement, creating a subtle humming noise as it interacted with the surrounding environment."
True,138530e,N,1,"The vibration could be mechanical while the statement describes a humming sound, which suggests an electrical source."
True,138530e,N,2,The intensity of the sensation might differ; vibration implies a tactile sense while humming involves auditory perception.
True,138530e,N,3,"The object could be vibrating internally and externally without producing any audible sound, contradicting the quiet humming."
True,138530e,C,1,Vibration and humming are distinct sensations; vibration implies a shaking motion while humming suggests a continuous low-pitched sound.

True,51353e,E,2,"This idea has been overused in various media forms such as films, books, and television shows, making it less original."
True,51353e,E,3,"Similar portrayals have become predictable and expected in devil-related narratives, leading to a sense of cliché."
