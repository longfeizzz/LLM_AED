1. The statement does not align with the given context which explicitly states that a bigger contribution "may or may not mean" strong support for Candidate X. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that a bigger contribution means to support Candidate Y without additional information.
2. The context introduces a contrasting idea about freedom of association being an "even bigger stretch," suggesting that the notion of contributions being indicative of strong support might be considered an overreach or exaggeration.
3. Justice Thomas's perspective on freedom of association is presented as something he would dismiss, implying skepticism towards claims of significant support based solely on financial contributions. This further undermines the assumption that a bigger contribution directly indicates strong support.
