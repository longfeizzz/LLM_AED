1. The context does not specify the exact factors involved in judicial decisions, leaving room for ambiguity about whether race is one of them.
2. Kennedy's statement implies that even if race is not the sole factor, its presence introduces a risk of becoming the decisive factor, which is undetermined without further information on specific cases.
3. The context focuses on the potential for race to become decisive, but does not confirm its current status as one of several factors in actual judicial decisions.
4. There could be variability across different jurisdictions or types of cases, making it impossible to generalize that race is always one of several factors in judicial decisions.
5. The statement does not provide empirical data or examples to support the claim that race is indeed one of several factors in judicial decisions.
