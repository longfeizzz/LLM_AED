1. Discounted flights often use the same safety measures and protocols as full-priced flights, ensuring safety remains a priority.
2. Airlines may cut costs in areas other than safety to offer discounts, focusing instead on fuel efficiency, operational practices, or ancillary services.
3. Regulatory bodies enforce strict safety standards that apply to all airlines, regardless of pricing strategies, thus maintaining consistent safety levels across the board.
