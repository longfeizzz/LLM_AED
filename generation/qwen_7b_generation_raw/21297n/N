1. The context does not specify what object was used in the hypothetical scenario of being "walloped."
2. A spoon is generally too small and light to cause significant impact compared to other objects that might be used to "wallop" someone.
3. The intensity of the emotional response described in the context ("like his mother had just walloped him") may not match the mild sensation one would experience from a spoon.
4. Different objects could elicit varying levels of emotional reaction, making the comparison between a "wallop" and a spoon hit unclear.
