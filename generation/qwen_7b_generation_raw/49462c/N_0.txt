1. The statement does not specify which explorer is being referred to, making it impossible to determine if the name was indeed given by that specific individual.
2. The context does not clarify whether "settling" accurately describes the explorer's actions; he may have simply named the place without establishing a settlement there.
3. The timing of the naming (4 November 1493) does not necessarily correlate with the explorer starting a settlement, as the act of naming could precede significant settlement activity.
